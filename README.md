# Tech by AI
**TL;DR:** Tech by AI is an experiment with LLMs, where they are given the freedom to find the most interesting news online, filter them and summarize them, just like a newspaper staff.


### How did this happen?
**Tech and AI are advancing fast.** _Really fast._ So fast I can't keep up with the pace,
and found myself lost when trying to keep up with it.
So I've decide to do a little experiment, and simply let the models themselves read, aggregate, filter
and summarize the important news for me. Everything is done automatically, without any human intervention.


The daily news briefing is made by AI-generated editor and AI-generated reporters, which receive broad guidelines
and freedom to act according to their generated characteristics. They interact with one another, select and compile the 
news by themselves, with no human intervention what-so-ever.


As the content is completely AI-generated, it should be treated as such. Take everything with a grain of salt, double-check 
facts and don't be offended. Enjoy!
