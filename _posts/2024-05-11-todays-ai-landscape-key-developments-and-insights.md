# Apple Will Revamp Siri to Catch Up to Its Chatbot Competitors
_Summarized by: Evan Jacobs_ [[www.nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/business/apple-siri-ai-chatgpt.html)]

Apple is set to revamp Siri by integrating generative AI, enhancing its conversational capabilities to compete with advanced chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Since its 2011 launch, Siri has lagged in maintaining dialogues and often misunderstood queries. This update, part of a broader initiative to embed generative AI in Apple's operations, will debut at the annual developers conference on June 10. The upgraded Siri will engage in ongoing dialogues, not just isolated responses. Additionally, Apple plans to boost iPhone memory and may license AI models from other companies to enhance Siri's performance.

AMD has released the Micro Engine Scheduler (MES) documentation for RDNA3 GPUs on GPUOpen.com, responding to Tiny Corp's demands for more transparent software support. This is part of AMD's initiative to open-source its GPU stack, enhancing its competitiveness against Nvidia in the AI and GPU compute markets. Tiny Corp, having developed workarounds for the MES, continues to press for additional documentation on PM4 packets and the COMPUTE_DISPATCH_INITIATOR. The MES firmware release is expected soon, pending legal clearances.

# Artificial Intelligence for health: opportunities, risks, and governance
_Summarized by: Mira Singh_ [[www.who.int](https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2024/05/30/default-calendar/artificial-intelligence-for-health-opportunities-risks-and-governance)]

Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds transformative potential for global health, offering advancements in surveillance, drug development, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. It promises to enhance service accessibility, address workforce shortages, and reduce healthcare costs. However, the effective deployment of AI in health depends on robust governance frameworks that ensure equity, data protection, and adherence to regulations and policies. The upcoming strategic roundtable at the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly in Geneva will focus on leveraging AI to strengthen health systems globally. It aims to initiate discussions on a renewed Global Strategy on Digital Health and AI, set priorities for the Global Initiative on AI for Health, and outline roles for various stakeholders in supporting AI's integration into health systems. The session will also address the challenges of public-private partnerships and regulatory oversight, emphasizing the need for a collaborative approach to harness AI's benefits while safeguarding human rights and privacy.

# Regulating Artificial Intelligence
_Summarized by: Mira Singh_ [[digitalpolicyalert.org](https://digitalpolicyalert.org/threads/regulating-artificial-intelligence)]

Artificial intelligence (AI) regulation is increasingly becoming a focal point for governments worldwide. Various laws, orders, standards, and guidelines are being issued to manage the development and application of AI technologies. These regulatory measures often include prohibitions on certain AI applications, mandates for transparency reports and risk assessments from AI developers, and the enhancement of rights for affected parties such as employees, data subjects, and users. These parties may be impacted in various contexts, including employment processes, targeted advertising, or content recommendation systems. This growing diversity in policy approaches reflects the complexity and expanding influence of AI in multiple sectors.
