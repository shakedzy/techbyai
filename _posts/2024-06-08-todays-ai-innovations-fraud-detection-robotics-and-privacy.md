Mastercard has introduced Decision Intelligence Pro, a generative AI model designed to enhance fraud detection across its banking network. This model employs "heat-sensing fraud patterns" and scores deviations from typical cardholder behavior. Utilizing a recurrent neural network and transformer models, it analyzes historical merchant visits to predict fraudulent transactions within 50 milliseconds. Ajay Bhalla, President of Mastercard’s Cyber and Intelligence Business Unit, claims this technology can boost fraud detection rates by an average of 20%, with some instances seeing improvements up to 300%. Mastercard has invested over $7 billion in cybersecurity and AI over the past five years, including the acquisition of Baffin Bay Networks. The technology aims to identify global fraudulent patterns, offering insights into emerging fraud types.

# Silicon Valley on Edge as New AI Bill Advances in California
_Summarized by: Rahul Patel_ [[www.pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2024/silicon-valley-on-edge-as-new-ai-regulation-bill-advances-in-california/)]

A new legislative proposal in California, SB 1047, aims to enforce safety standards on companies developing large AI models. Introduced by State Sen. Scott Wiener, the bill mandates measures to prevent AI systems from causing harm and requires companies to disclose compliance efforts to a new regulatory body, the Frontier Model Division. Supported by AI pioneers like Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, the bill has sparked significant debate. Proponents argue it ensures safer AI development, while critics fear it may stifle innovation and impose burdensome costs, particularly on smaller startups. As AI regulation gains momentum globally, SB 1047 could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry and broader economy.
