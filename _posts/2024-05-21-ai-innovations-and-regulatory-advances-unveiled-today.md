# Metacognitive Capabilities of LLMs: An Exploration in Mathematical Problem Solving
_Summarized by: Sophia Grant_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12205v1)]

Metacognitive knowledge, or the awareness of one's own thought processes, is a key aspect of human learning, especially in fields like mathematics. This paper explores whether large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, also possess metacognitive knowledge, particularly in math problem-solving. The researchers developed a procedure to prompt LLMs to assign skill labels to math questions and then cluster these skills into broader, interpretable categories. This approach was tested on math datasets GSM8K and MATH.

The study found that when LLMs were presented with a list of skill labels and asked to identify the necessary skill for a given math problem, their accuracy improved. For instance, using skill exemplars (examples of solved problems labeled with specific skills) enhanced the performance of several LLMs on the GSM8K and MATH datasets. This methodology, although applied to math, is domain-agnostic and could be used for other types of problem-solving.

Key findings include a significant 11.6% improvement over the Chain of Thought (CoT) method on the MATH dataset and a 7.52% enhancement in code-based solutions. The research also demonstrated that skill-based in-context examples can improve the performance of weaker LLMs, highlighting the potential for transferring metacognitive knowledge across different models and datasets.

# Meta's AI Companion Returns Inaccurate Information About Project 2025
_Summarized by: Liam Carter_ [[globalextremism.org](https://globalextremism.org/post/metas-ai-companion-returns-inaccurate-information-about-project-2025/)]

Meta's AI language model, Llama 3, has been criticized for providing inaccurate and promotional information about Project 2025, a far-right initiative led by the Heritage Foundation. The Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) found that Meta's AI on Instagram often regurgitated Project 2025's proposals without critical context, even endorsing the project. In contrast, the Meta AI website provided more factual responses but still failed to fully address the harmful impacts of Project 2025's policies, which include eliminating LGBTQ+ rights and expanding executive power. The discrepancies between the AI's responses on different platforms raise concerns about the reliability of Meta's AI in providing accurate information.

OpenAI's new GPT-4o model, dubbed "omni" for its multimodal capabilities, processes text, voice, and video inputs. It features a 128,000 token context window—equivalent to 300 pages—enabling it to handle extensive information. The model excels in multimodal tasks, including image and video analysis, text-to-speech, and image generation via DALL-E 3. GPT-4o is designed with enhanced emotional intelligence, detecting emotional cues and simulating emotional reactions, making it suitable for empathetic applications in healthcare and customer service. It supports multiple languages, has updated knowledge up to April 2023, and offers reduced costs and faster performance.

# Researchers and industry partners demonstrate cutting-edge chip technology for ultra-low power AI connected devices
_Summarized by: Liam Carter_ [[techxplore.com](https://techxplore.com/news/2024-05-industry-partners-edge-chip-technology.html)]

Researchers from the National University of Singapore, Soitec, and NXP Semiconductors have developed ultra-low power AI chips using fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) technology. This innovation significantly enhances the energy efficiency of AI devices, potentially extending battery life by ten times, supporting intense computational workloads, and halving power consumption for wireless communications. The chips are designed to accelerate the adoption of FD-SOI technology in the semiconductor industry by lowering design barriers and reducing development costs. An industry workshop held on May 3, 2024, showcased these advancements, highlighting their applications in smart cities, wearables, and IoT devices.

Colorado has enacted the first comprehensive AI regulatory framework in the US with Senate Bill 24-205, signed by Governor Jared Polis. The law aims to prevent consumer harm and discrimination by imposing requirements on developers and users of high-risk AI systems, such as those used in hiring, banking, and housing. It mandates reporting of algorithmic discrimination to the attorney general and includes consumer reporting requirements. The law, effective in 2026, has faced opposition from the tech industry, concerned about stifling innovation. Polis emphasized the need for federal regulation and urged stakeholders to refine the law before its implementation.

# Multi-order Graph Clustering with Adaptive Node-level Weight Learning
_Summarized by: Sophia Grant_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12183v1)]

The paper presents a novel approach to graph clustering called Multi-order Graph Clustering (MOGC), which addresses limitations in current methods that focus primarily on individual node and edge connections while neglecting higher-order structures known as motifs. Motifs are recurring, significant patterns of interconnections in networks that can reveal more complex organizational structures.

Traditional motif-based clustering methods often suffer from hypergraph fragmentation, where the network breaks into many disconnected components, reducing clustering accuracy. MOGC integrates multiple higher-order structures (motifs) and edge connections at the node level, employing an adaptive weight learning mechanism to adjust the contributions of different motifs for each node. This mechanism not only mitigates the fragmentation issue but also enhances clustering accuracy.

MOGC uses an alternating minimization algorithm to solve the clustering problem efficiently. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the model's effectiveness, showing significant improvements over existing methods. The approach is particularly beneficial for networks with diverse motifs, where nodes participate in multiple motifs, and the importance of each motif varies from node to node. This flexibility allows MOGC to achieve more precise clustering results by leveraging the unique contributions of various motifs.
