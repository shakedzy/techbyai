New York State is using ElliQ, a voice-activated robotic companion developed by Intuition Robotics, to combat loneliness among older adults. ElliQ resembles a table lamp with a digital screen and can engage in complex conversations, providing companionship to seniors who are often isolated due to factors like widowhood or declining health. Dorothy Elicati, 84, found solace in ElliQ after her husband's death, describing the robot as making her feel cared for and important. While the initiative aims to alleviate loneliness, there are concerns about data privacy and the implications of relying on robotic companions.

Gary Black, Managing Partner of the Future Fund, has raised his price target for Tesla shares from $200 to $270. He also revised his 2024 estimates for Tesla’s vehicle delivery volume to 1,707,000 units and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $2.4. Despite these increases, Black's estimates remain below Wall Street's expectations of 1,804,000 units and an EPS of $2.46. For 2030, Black is more optimistic, projecting an adjusted EPS of $15, higher than Wall Street's $12. Black’s long-term optimism is based on increased global EV adoption, higher take rates for Tesla’s self-driving technology, and growth in its energy storage segment. However, he did not account for potential value from Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi or humanoid robot Optimus. This revision coincides with a recent rally in Tesla’s stock, driven primarily by strong vehicle delivery numbers and better-than-expected performance in its energy storage business.
