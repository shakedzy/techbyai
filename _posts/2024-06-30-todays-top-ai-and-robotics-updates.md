X, formerly known as Twitter, has introduced a new feature called Stories, powered by Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok, to summarize personalized trending news. Available to Premium subscribers, these summaries appear in the Explore section's For You tab. Grok provides overviews of trending topics by summarizing associated posts, although it includes a disclaimer about potential errors. This feature builds on Twitter's previous trend annotations but uses AI for consistency. Grok's summaries are based on conversations on X, not the actual article text, which raises concerns about accuracy and misinformation. This move is part of X's strategy to boost Premium subscriptions, offering access to Grok's real-time data summaries. The impact on traffic to news sites remains uncertain, with some publishers partnering with AI providers to adapt.
