# PuzzleAvatar: Assembling D Avatars from Personal Albums
_Summarized by: Sophia Bennett_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14869v1)]

PuzzleAvatar is a model designed to create highly accurate 3D avatars from personal "Outfit Of The Day" (OOTD) photo collections. Unlike traditional methods that require controlled environments, PuzzleAvatar can handle casual photos with varied poses, camera angles, lighting, and backgrounds, as long as the outfit, hairstyle, and accessories remain consistent.

The model works by breaking down these photos into separate tokens representing different aspects such as appearance, identity, garments, hairstyles, and accessories. These tokens are then used to fine-tune a vision-language model, which learns to generate a personalized 3D avatar by treating these tokens like pieces of a puzzle.

PuzzleAvatar allows easy customization of avatars by interchanging these tokens. For instance, users can edit specific attributes or perform virtual try-ons. The model is evaluated using a new dataset called PuzzleIOI, which contains challenging real-world photos paired with ground-truth 3D bodies. Results show that PuzzleAvatar achieves high reconstruction accuracy and robustness, outperforming other methods like TeCH and MVDreamBooth in both shape and texture quality.

The model's modularity and token-based approach make it a versatile tool for various downstream applications, including avatar editing and animation. Future work aims to improve computational efficiency and explore decentralized training for broader customization capabilities.

# A Nurse is Blue and Elephant is Rugby: Cross Domain Alignment in Large Language Models Reveal Human-like Patterns
_Summarized by: Sophia Bennett_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14863v1)]

Cross-domain alignment is the task of mapping a concept from one domain to another, such as asking "If a doctor were a color, what color would it be?" This study adapts this task to evaluate the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). By analyzing LLMs' responses to cross-domain mapping tasks and their explanations, the study reveals that LLMs exhibit human-like patterns in conceptualization and reasoning.

The researchers used human data to prompt several LLMs, including Flan and Llama models, with cross-domain mapping tasks. The results showed that LLMs' mappings significantly aligned with human responses, often surpassing individual human participants in agreement with the most popular answers. This indicates that LLMs can perform cross-domain mappings similarly to humans.

The study also examined the explanations provided by LLMs for their mappings, categorizing them into types such as perceptual similarity and abstract alignment. The distribution of these categories in LLMs' explanations closely matched those of humans, suggesting that LLMs rely on similar reasoning processes. However, LLMs tended to provide more detailed explanations compared to the often concise human responses.

Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs not only mimic human-like behavior in cross-domain tasks but also demonstrate similar reasoning patterns, highlighting their potential to model human conceptualization and reasoning effectively.

# GITAI: Avatar robot for developments on the space station and on the Moon
_Summarized by: Ethan Clarke_ [[www.esa.int](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Technology_Transfer/GITAI_Avatar_robot_for_developments_on_the_space_station_and_on_the_Moon)]

GITAI, a Japanese start-up, has developed a humanoid telepresence robot called "Avatar" for use in space stations and lunar development. Controlled remotely via VR headsets, motion capture suits, and haptic gloves, the Avatar allows operators to see, hear, and interact in real-time. It uses advanced data reduction and compression algorithms to minimize visual data from 800Mbps to 2.5Mbps, ensuring low-latency communication (100ms) over standard WIFI networks. This technology enables scientists to conduct experiments remotely, reducing the need for human presence in space. GITAI's innovations include workload reduction and NAT traversal systems, facilitating efficient remote operations. The European Space Agency (ESA) supports such start-ups through its extensive network of Business Incubation Centres, fostering over 650 start-ups and integrating space-related entrepreneurship across Europe.
