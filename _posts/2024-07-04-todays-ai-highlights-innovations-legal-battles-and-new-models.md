Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful tools for generative learning, converting data into a simple Gaussian distribution. However, encoding complex, multimodal data into a single continuous Gaussian distribution can be challenging. Discrete-Continuous Latent Variable Diffusion Models (DisCo-Diff) address this by introducing discrete latent variables alongside continuous ones. These discrete latents, learned through an encoder, simplify the DM's task by reducing the complexity of the noise-to-data mapping.

DisCo-Diff is trained end-to-end, without relying on pre-trained networks, making it universally applicable. The discrete latents help by reducing the curvature of the DM's generative ordinary differential equation (ODE). An autoregressive transformer models the distribution of these discrete latents, requiring only a few variables with small codebooks.

The model is validated on various tasks, including image synthesis and molecular docking. For example, DisCo-Diff achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on the ImageNet-64/128 datasets. The discrete latents capture global appearance patterns, aiding in more accurate data generation. This framework significantly improves performance across different domains by leveraging both discrete and continuous latents effectively.

Meta has unveiled 3D Gen, an AI model that converts text prompts into 3D images in under a minute. According to Meta, 3D Gen outperforms existing solutions by 3-10 times in speed. The model integrates Metaâ€™s previous text-to-image and text-to-texture models, allowing users to modify 3D images with additional text inputs. Testers preferred 3D Gen over competitors 68% of the time. Although not publicly available yet, experts believe this technology could revolutionize creative fields such as gaming, film effects, and VR applications.

New research from Radboud University reveals widespread "open-washing" in generative AI, where companies like Meta and Google claim openness without true transparency. The study surveyed 45 models, finding that major corporations often use terms like "open source" for marketing, while smaller entities like AllenAI and BigScience Workshop genuinely document and open their systems. The EU AI Act, which offers exemptions for "open source" models, lacks a clear definition, incentivizing this practice. The research emphasizes the need for clear standards of openness to foster innovation, trust, and regulatory compliance in AI.

The rise of AI in the music industry has led to legal battles over copyright infringement, with major record labels suing AI music generators Suno and Udio. These companies are accused of using copyrighted recordings without permission to train their AI models, producing outputs similar to original works. The lawsuits highlight the urgent need for clear regulations on AI-generated content and intellectual property. While AI offers significant creative potential, businesses must navigate the legal risks by ensuring transparency and proper licensing of training data. Success stories like "BBL Drizzy" demonstrate that human creativity and AI can coexist, but legal clarity is essential for future innovation.
