_Summarized by: Jordan Lee_ [[programbusiness.com](https://programbusiness.com/news/2024-survey-reveals-crucial-ethical-ai-adoption-challenges-in-insurance-industry/)]

The 2024 Ethical AI in Insurance Consortium Survey highlights a pivotal moment for the insurance industry's engagement with artificial intelligence (AI). With 80% of companies either utilizing AI for business decisions or planning to within the year, the sector faces significant hurdles including cost, data quality, and bias. Despite these challenges, the adoption of AI in operational decisions, such as claims and underwriting, is expected to surge, with only 14% currently leveraging AI but with projections indicating a steep increase. The survey emphasizes the transformative impact of AI on operational efficiency and accuracy, as noted by Douglas Benalan, CIO of CURE Insurance. However, ethical considerations and the need for collaborative frameworks are paramount. Key findings reveal a strong focus on IT, sales, and marketing departments in AI adoption, alongside notable improvements in operational efficiency and revenue. Nevertheless, 69% of respondents express dissatisfaction with current processes to address AI model biases, underscoring the need for comprehensive employee education and regular AI model assessments. The survey also calls for urgent regulatory guidance and training in AI legislation, highlighting the industry's collective push towards responsible AI implementation.

# IAPP GPS 2024: Growing Complexities of Digital Governance and AI Regulation
_Summarized by: Jordan Lee_ [[iapp.org](https://iapp.org/news/a/iapp-gps-2024-organizations-regulators-face-growing-complexities-of-digital-governance/)]

In the IAPP Global Privacy Summit 2024, the spotlight was on the escalating complexities of digital governance and AI regulation, marking a significant shift from traditional privacy and data protection concerns. The summit underscored the need for privacy professionals and regulators to adopt broader roles to navigate the intricate digital landscape, where personal data intersects with artificial intelligence, commercial surveillance, biometrics, cybersecurity, and more. U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter highlighted the FTC's proactive stance in addressing these challenges across various domains, emphasizing the importance of an integrated approach rather than confined silos. Similarly, Australian Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind, drawing on her experience, advocated for leveraging lessons from privacy and data protection to inform AI governance practices, stressing the importance of principles that prioritize citizens and consumers.

Organizations are grappling with the complexities of adhering to an increasingly fragmented regulatory landscape, especially in the EU where a multitude of digital regulations coexist. Mastercard and IBM shared insights into their strategies for fostering cohesive digital governance, emphasizing values-driven approaches and the importance of cross-functional collaboration. The discussions also touched on the challenges of compliance, particularly in relation to AI, and the role of privacy professionals in leveraging existing risk structures to navigate these challenges effectively. The summit's dialogues highlighted a collective effort towards establishing robust digital governance practices to enhance consumer trust and ensure responsible technological advancement.

# AI and Cybersecurity: Guard Against 'Poisoning' Attacks
_Summarized by: Jordan Lee_ [[aibusiness.com](https://aibusiness.com/nlp/ai-and-cybersecurity-inserting-bad-data-in-poisoning-attacks)]

In the evolving landscape of AI and cybersecurity, a new U.S. government study highlights the vulnerability of AI systems to 'poisoning attacks.' These attacks involve malicious actors corrupting the data used to train AI models, potentially leading to the spread of misinformation, unreliable outcomes, and a general undermining of trust in AI systems. Such vulnerabilities are particularly concerning in critical sectors like finance, healthcare, and government services. The study, co-authored by Northeastern University professor Alina Oprea, emphasizes that these attacks are relatively easy to execute with minimal knowledge of the AI system. The integrity of training data is crucial as AI systems, including self-driving vehicles and medical diagnostic aids, rely on extensive data analysis for learning. Defending against these attacks is challenging, requiring robust security measures throughout the AI system's creation and deployment. Experts suggest sourcing training material from original sources and implementing comprehensive security policies, including red teaming, data privacy controls, and ongoing validation processes. This approach is essential for securing AI systems against manipulation and ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness.

# Chatting With Nvidia's Generative AI Characters Felt Like Next-Level DnD
_Summarized by: Morgan Kim_ [[www.cnet.com](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/chatting-with-nvidias-generative-ai-characters-felt-like-next-level-dnd/)]

At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2024, Nvidia showcased its innovative NEO NPC technology, offering a glimpse into the future of gaming with generative AI. The technology allows for dynamic interactions with non-player characters (NPCs), creating responses on the fly that can significantly enhance the gaming experience. Unlike traditional generative AI tools, Nvidia's focus is on experiential tools that expand developers' capabilities, allowing for more immersive and interactive game environments. Concerns among developers about AI impacting their roles were addressed, emphasizing that writers are still essential for crafting the backstories that the AI draws from. Nvidia's demonstrations, including the ChatRTX and NPC AI technologies, highlighted the potential for more engaging and complex interactions within games. The partnership with AI engine creator InWorld and Ubisoft has led to experiments with adding emotional depth to NPCs, further enriching player engagement. However, the high-performance hardware required for these technologies, such as the Nvidia RTX 4080 and 4090 GPUs, raises questions about accessibility for the average gamer. Despite these challenges, Nvidia's foray into generative AI in gaming presents an exciting vision for the future, with the potential to revolutionize how players interact with game worlds and characters.
