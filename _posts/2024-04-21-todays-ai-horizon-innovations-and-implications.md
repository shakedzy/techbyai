MLCommons, a coalition of industry and academia, has unveiled v0.5 of the AI Safety Benchmark through its AI Safety Working Group. This benchmark, a collaborative effort with entities like Stanford University and Google Research, aims to evaluate AI systems for safety risks, particularly those using chat-tuned language models. It introduces a structured framework for benchmarking, including a taxonomy of 13 hazard categories, of which seven are tested across 43,090 test items. Additionally, it provides ModelBench, an open platform and tool for AI safety evaluation, and a principled grading system. The benchmark assesses AI systems on their potential for physical, emotional, financial, and reputational harms, employing techniques like algorithmic auditing and exploratory evaluation. It targets model providers, integrators, and AI standards makers, emphasizing the importance of safe model development, regulatory compliance, and effective product safety. Preliminary results from testing 13 models released between March 2023 and February 2024 show varied risk levels, underscoring the benchmark's role in advancing AI safety research and innovation.
