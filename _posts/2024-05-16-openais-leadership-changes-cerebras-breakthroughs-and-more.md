OpenAI is experiencing a significant leadership shakeup with the departure of Jan Leike, a close colleague of chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who also recently resigned. This follows earlier exits by other key figures, raising concerns about the stability of OpenAI's AI safety team. Leike and Sutskever were leading efforts to ensure the safe development of artificial superintelligence (ASI). Their departures come amid financial pressures and the need for substantial investment to advance AI capabilities. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, remains committed to the company’s goals, despite the internal turmoil and external competition from rivals like Google.

# AI chip company Cerebras announces major advances in materials science, sparse training and more - SiliconANGLE
_Summarized by: Ethan Rodriguez_ [[siliconangle.com](https://siliconangle.com/2024/05/15/ai-chip-company-cerebras-announces-major-advances-materials-science-sparse-training-sovereign-ai-development/)]

Cerebras Systems Inc., an AI chip startup, has announced significant advancements in materials science and sparse training, positioning itself as a competitor to Nvidia Corp. The company revealed breakthroughs in molecular dynamics simulations, achieving speeds 179 times faster than the world's top supercomputer, and a 70% parameter reduction in large language model training. These achievements are part of a multiyear partnership with Aleph Alpha GmbH to develop secure AI solutions for government agencies, including Germany’s armed forces. Cerebras' new WSE-3 processor, with 1.4 trillion transistors and 900,000 compute cores, is set to launch later this year.

# Harmonizing Human Insights and AI Precision: Hand in Hand for Advancing Knowledge Graph Task
_Summarized by: Ava Thompson_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09477v1)]

The paper discusses the development of KG-HAIT, a Human-AI Teaming (HAIT) system designed to enhance Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for link prediction in knowledge graphs (KGs). Knowledge graphs are vast networks of entities and their relationships, but they often lack completeness. Link prediction aims to fill these gaps by predicting missing links between entities.

KG-HAIT leverages human insights through a dynamic programming (DP) approach to generate Human Insightful Feature (HIF) vectors. These vectors encapsulate the structural and semantic features of subgraphs around entities. By integrating these HIF vectors into the training of KGE models, significant improvements in performance and faster convergence rates are observed across multiple benchmarks.

The paper highlights the complementary strengths of humans and AI: humans excel in conceptual analysis and critical thinking, while AI handles large datasets with precision. KG-HAIT demonstrates that combining these strengths leads to better link prediction outcomes. Experiments show that KGE models augmented with HIF vectors outperform their original versions in various metrics, including mean rank and hit rates at different thresholds.

Overall, KG-HAIT showcases the potential of human-AI collaboration in enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge graph analysis, paving the way for more advanced and insightful AI systems.

# Facilitating Opinion Diversity through Hybrid NLP Approaches
_Summarized by: Ava Thompson_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09439v1)]

Modern democracies are grappling with declining citizen participation in decision-making. Online discussion forums offer a potential solution by facilitating large-scale citizen engagement. This thesis proposal addresses the challenges of managing and interpreting the vast amounts of content generated in these forums using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and hybrid human-AI technologies.

The proposal outlines a three-layered hierarchy for representing perspectives: stance, arguments, and values. Stance detection involves identifying support or opposition to claims, arguments provide reasons for these stances, and values reveal the deeper motivations behind opinions. While NLP can process large-scale data, it struggles with capturing diverse perspectives and minority opinions due to biases and limitations in current models.

To overcome these challenges, the proposal advocates for a hybrid approach, combining human intelligence with NLP. Humans can provide deeper contextual understanding and correct biases, while NLP can handle large-scale data processing. This synergy aims to enhance the quality of online discussions by ensuring diverse opinions are represented and understood.

The research focuses on three key questions: the fundamental issues in using NLP for perspective analysis, how to effectively combine human and machine intelligence, and how to integrate different tasks to represent diverse opinions in online discussions. The ultimate goal is to improve democratic processes and support better decision-making through enriched online deliberations.

# NVIDIA, Teradyne, Siemens Discuss Autonomous Machines, AI | NVIDIA Blog
_Summarized by: Ethan Rodriguez_ [[blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-teradyne-siemens-robotics-autonomous-machines-ai/)]

Senior executives from NVIDIA, Siemens, and Teradyne Robotics gathered in Odense, Denmark, to inaugurate Teradyne's new headquarters and discuss AI's transformative impact on robotics. Odense, a hub for robotics with over 160 companies, hosts Teradyne's new facility, fostering innovation and collaboration. The event featured a panel with leaders from Teradyne, Siemens, and NVIDIA, emphasizing the role of generative AI, simulation, and digital twins in advancing robotics. The collaboration among these companies aims to enhance robotic capabilities, autonomy, and safety. NVIDIA's AI hardware and software integrations, alongside Siemens' automation solutions, are pivotal in this evolution. The panel highlighted the importance of partnerships in driving innovation and addressing industry challenges, with AI enabling robots to navigate, learn, and make decisions autonomously. This collaboration is set to revolutionize manufacturing and other industries by improving efficiency, safety, and productivity through advanced robotics.

# Matching domain experts by training from scratch on domain knowledge
_Summarized by: Ava Thompson_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09395v1)]

Researchers trained a small GPT-2 model (124M parameters) on neuroscience-specific data to predict the outcomes of neuroscience experiments, achieving human-level performance. They used 1.3 billion tokens from neuroscience literature, either to fine-tune a pretrained GPT-2 or to train a new model from scratch with a custom tokenizer. Despite the smaller model size and less training data compared to larger language models, both approaches yielded 63% accuracy on the BrainBench benchmark, comparable to human experts. This study highlights the effectiveness of domain-specific training and specialized tokenization in achieving expert-level performance with smaller models.
