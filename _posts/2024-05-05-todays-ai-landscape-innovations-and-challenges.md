# Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models
_Summarized by: Ethan Clarke_ [[blog.athina.ai](https://blog.athina.ai/emergent-abilities-of-large-language-models)]

Large Language Models (LLMs) are showing emergent abilities as they scale, including Few-Shot Learning, where they learn and perform tasks with minimal examples, and an enhanced grasp of language nuances, enabling sophisticated interactions. These emergent properties, unpredictable and absent in smaller models, pose challenges in measurement and leverage but also open new innovation avenues in AI. The scale of LLMs, influencing these abilities, continues to be a key research area, vital for advancing natural language processing technologies and presenting both opportunities and challenges for AI engineers in major corporations.

# Evolving Artificial Intelligence Paradigms in HealthCare
_Summarized by: Ethan Clarke_ [[www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/evolving-artificial-intelligence-paradigms-healthcare-pascal-bouquet-yunkf)]

The article discusses the evolution of AI paradigms in healthcare, highlighting the shift towards more sustainable and specialized AI models. Traditional large, data-intensive AI models are becoming unsustainable due to their high resource demands. The future points to the development of AI agents—autonomous systems capable of understanding and solving real-world problems across various domains. These AI agents, especially when combined with federated learning, offer significant potential for privacy-preserving, decentralized learning and action-taking capabilities. Federated learning allows for the training of models on distributed datasets without compromising data privacy, which is crucial in sensitive fields like healthcare. This approach not only enhances privacy but also allows AI agents to access a broader range of knowledge and skills, thereby improving adaptability and ethical standards in AI deployments. The article suggests that these advancements could lead to robust, versatile AI agents that can operate autonomously and make informed decisions based on a wide array of decentralized data sources.

Qualcomm Inc has launched the Cloud AI 100, an AI inference chip aimed at the expanding market, challenging leaders like Nvidia and Intel. This chip, tailored for tasks such as converting audio to text, is set for testing with partners like Microsoft, with mass production slated for 2020. Unlike its rivals focusing on large data centers, Qualcomm's chip is designed for smaller facilities, emphasizing energy efficiency and low heat output, leveraging their mobile chip expertise. This move marks a strategic pivot from Qualcomm’s earlier, less successful venture into the data center sector dominated by Intel.

Apple is currently in talks with Google to incorporate the Gemini AI engine into its iPhone lineup, potentially enhancing device capabilities with new AI-driven features. These discussions also involve Microsoft-backed OpenAI. While Apple continues to develop its own AI models for the upcoming iOS 18, it is seeking external partnerships to bolster its generative AI capabilities, which could include creating images and writing essays from prompts. Details of the agreement, including terms and implementation, are still under negotiation, with a potential announcement expected at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June. This collaboration underscores Apple's strategic efforts to keep pace with competitors like Microsoft and Google in the generative AI space.

_Summarized by: Nadia Lopez_ [[aibusiness.com](https://aibusiness.com/verticals/turkey-publishes-its-national-artificial-intelligence-strategy)]

Turkey has launched its National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for 2021-2025, aiming to position itself among the top 20 nations in AI by enhancing AI education, employment, and research. The strategy, developed by the Digital Transformation Office and the Ministry of Industry and Technology, outlines six strategic priorities including boosting AI education and employment, supporting AI research, fostering innovation, improving data and infrastructure access, enhancing socioeconomic adaptation, and strengthening international cooperation. Specific targets include increasing AI's GDP contribution to 5%, raising AI employment to 50,000, and graduating an additional 10,000 AI specialists within five years. The strategy also emphasizes Turkey's commitment to international AI regulatory and standardization efforts. However, it omits any mention of AI's role in surveillance, despite past criticisms of Turkey's surveillance practices following the 2016 coup attempt.

Boston Dynamics has unveiled a new fully electric version of its Atlas robot, named Atlas 2.0, designed for real-world applications. This model marks a departure from previous hydraulic versions, offering enhanced strength and versatility. Capable of performing complex manipulations and movements that surpass human capabilities, Atlas 2.0 can rotate 360 degrees at all joints. It is aimed at handling tasks in environments that are dull, dirty, and dangerous. Initially, it will be deployed in Hyundai's next-generation factories. This advancement raises important questions about the impact of such robots on employment and the necessity of their integration in ways that complement human workers.
