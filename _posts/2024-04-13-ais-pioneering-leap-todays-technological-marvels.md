# MindEye2: Shared-Subject Models Enable fMRI-To-Image With 1 Hour of Data
_Summarized by: Sophie Lee_ [[stability.ai](https://stability.ai/news/mindeye2-fmri-to-image-with-1-hour-of-data)]

MedARC, alongside Stability AI and other research institutions, has developed MindEye2, a revolutionary fMRI-to-image reconstruction model. This tool can generate high-quality images from brain activity with just 1 hour of fMRI data, significantly improving on previous methods that needed up to 40 hours. MindEye2 pre-trains on data from multiple subjects before fine-tuning with a new participant's data, allowing for high-fidelity image reconstructions with minimal data. This innovation paves the way for new clinical applications and brain-computer interfaces, providing novel diagnostic and communication tools for patients with neurological conditions. By mapping fMRI brain activity to CLIP space and utilizing shared-subject modeling, MindEye2 sets new benchmarks in image retrieval, reconstruction, and caption generation metrics across multiple subjects. This advancement highlights the potential of deep learning models in neuroimaging data, making it feasible for patients to undergo a single MRI session for detailed visual perception reconstructions.

# Towards an international regulatory framework for AI safety: lessons from the EU AI Act
_Summarized by: Sophie Lee_ [[www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-03017-1)]

The study, "Towards an international regulatory framework for AI safety," draws parallels between IAEA’s nuclear safety regulations and the need for standardized AI safety norms.
