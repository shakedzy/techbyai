OpenAI has introduced GPT-4o, an advanced AI model capable of interacting via audio, vision, and text in real-time. This new model aims to provide a more natural human-computer interaction, responding to queries in under a third of a second. Utilizing a smartphone's camera and microphone, GPT-4o can understand visual and auditory inputs and respond with a personalized, natural voice. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, described the technology as "magic" and the best computer interface he has ever used. GPT-4o will be offered for free and has undergone extensive testing to mitigate risks such as bias and misinformation. Despite its capabilities, the model has some limitations, including language switching errors and mispronunciations.
