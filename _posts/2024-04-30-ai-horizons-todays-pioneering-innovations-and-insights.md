Google Gemini, developed by Google's DeepMind and Google Research, features a suite of generative AI models: Gemini Ultra, Pro, and Nano, each catering to different needs. These multimodal models excel in various tasks, including speech transcription and artwork generation, by processing audio, images, videos, and text in multiple languages. While skepticism exists due to past underdeliveries, Google asserts Gemini's prowess in problem-solving and multimodal interactions. Gemini Pro and Ultra are available on Google's AI platforms, whereas Gemini Nano, designed for mobile use, offers summarization and smart replies. Pricing varies, with select features free or in preview.

# DPO Meets PPO: Reinforced Token Optimization for RLHF

The paper introduces a novel framework for improving Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) by addressing the limitations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in capturing fine-grained token-wise information. The authors propose modeling RLHF problems as Markov decision processes (MDPs) to better utilize token-level data, a significant departure from the traditional sentence-level bandit formulation. This new approach, named Reinforced Token Optimization (RTO), combines Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO to learn and optimize a token-wise reward function derived from preference data. Theoretical analysis confirms RTO's efficiency in finding near-optimal policies, and extensive experiments validate its effectiveness in achieving better alignment in real-world scenarios. This research not only presents a practical solution to enhancing open-source implementations of PPO for RLHF but also opens new avenues for exploring the potential of token-wise information in reinforcement learning.
