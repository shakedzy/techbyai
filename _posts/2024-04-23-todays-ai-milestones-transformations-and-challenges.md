# AI Breakthrough: Researchers Develop Neural Operators for Deeper Physical Understanding
_Summarized by: Miles Turner_ [[www.sciencefocus.com](https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/ai-neural-operators-physical-understanding)]

In a groundbreaking development, researchers have introduced neural operators designed to enhance AI systems' comprehension of physical phenomena. This innovative approach, detailed at [Science Focus](https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/ai-neural-operators-physical-understanding), allows AI to grasp and predict complex physical processes more accurately than ever before. Unlike traditional methods that rely on pre-defined equations, these neural operators enable AI to learn directly from data, paving the way for more nuanced and dynamic understanding. This advancement holds promise for a wide array of applications, from improving climate models to advancing materials science. By bridging the gap between data-driven insights and physical laws, neural operators could revolutionize how AI interprets the natural world, offering a more profound, predictive, and practical grasp of the universe's intricacies.

# For the First Time, GPT Outperforms Medical Students on Board Exams
_Summarized by: Sophia Zheng_ [[www.hcinnovationgroup.com](https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/analytics-ai/news/55020061/for-the-first-time-gpt-outperforms-medical-students-on-board-exams)]

In a landmark study in *The New England Journal of Medicine*, researchers revealed GPT-4's superiority over medical students in board exams. Led by Uriel Katz, M.D., the study compared GPT-4 with 849 resident physicians across Israel in various specialties. GPT-4 excelled in psychiatry and matched the median in general surgery and internal medicine, but lagged slightly in pediatrics and OB/GYN. Unlike GPT-3.5, GPT-4 passed four out of five specialties tested. This breakthrough underscores the potential of integrating large language models into clinical practice, promising to enhance physician training and capabilities with AI advancements.

In 2024, the global cyber threat landscape evolves, with AI playing a dual role in empowering cybercriminals and enhancing defenses. The growing sophistication of threat actors, including state-sponsored attacks, underscores the critical importance of cybersecurity. The AI cybersecurity market, valued at $24.3 billion in 2023, is projected to reach $133.8 billion by 2030. This growth highlights AI's role in improving threat detection and minimizing false positives. However, AI also introduces challenges, such as the creation of deepfakes for phishing attacks. Despite the current limited use of Generative AI in cybercrime, its potential impact is significant. The battle against cyber threats heavily relies on both human and threat intelligence, which are crucial in educating and protecting against cybercrimes. Proxies are vital in collecting and analyzing threat intelligence, enabling effective defense strategies across strategic, operational, and tactical levels.

# Preparing for change: How businesses can thrive under the EU's AI act
_Summarized by: Leo Wallace_ [[www.nortonrosefulbright.com](https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en/knowledge/publications/228538a2/preparing-for-change-how-businesses-can-thrive-under-the-eus-ai-act)]

In April 2024, the EU's AI Act was confirmed, creating a strict legal framework for AI in the EU, focusing on safety and rights while promoting innovation. It affects AI providers, users, and manufacturers, requiring compliance with its provisions. The Act classifies AI systems by risk, imposing obligations on high-risk and general AI models. Penalties for non-compliance can reach €35 million or 7% of global turnover. Businesses must inventory AI systems, classify risks, educate stakeholders, and ensure ongoing compliance. This act marks a significant step in AI regulation in the EU.
