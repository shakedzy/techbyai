# U.S. Department of Transportation's Research Agency Advances Work to Incorporate Artificial Intelligence Safely into Transportation Applications
_Summarized by: David Chen_ [[www.transportation.gov](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-department-transportations-research-agency-advances-work-incorporate-artificial)]

The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Advanced Research Projects Agency - Infrastructure (ARPA-I) is seeking input on the integration of AI in transportation. This initiative follows Executive Order 14110, focusing on the safe and trustworthy development of AI. The Request for Information (RFI) invites stakeholders to discuss current and future AI applications, challenges, and opportunities in transportation, including autonomous mobility ecosystems. Dr. Robert C. Hampshire emphasizes AI's potential to enhance safety, efficiency, and equity in transportation. Stakeholders can submit comments by July 2, 2024, via the Federal Rulemaking Portal.

# See the Future at GTC 2024: NVIDIA's Jensen Huang to Unveil Latest Breakthroughs in Accelerated Computing, Generative AI and Robotics

# Training models responsibly: AI and creator rights
_Summarized by: David Chen_ [[www.ibc.org](https://www.ibc.org/features/training-models-responsibly-ai-and-creator-rights/10980.article)]

Sony Music has demanded AI companies disclose if their music was used for training, claiming copyright infringement. This highlights ethical concerns in AI training, particularly around copyright and fair use. Ed Newton-Rex, formerly of Stability AI, resigned over the company's stance on using copyrighted material without permission, arguing it undermines creators' rights and market value. He advocates for explicit consent and fair compensation for creators, proposing solutions like revenue-sharing and upfront payments. Newton-Rex founded Fairly Trained to certify AI models using licensed data, aiming to balance AI development with creators' rights. He stresses the need for responsible AI that assists rather than replaces human creativity.

# Microsoft Build 2024: CEO Nadella Declares 'A Golden Age Of AI'
_Summarized by: David Chen_ [[www.crn.com](https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2024/microsoft-build-2024-ceo-nadella-declares-a-golden-age-of-systems)]

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, at Build 2024, heralded a "golden age of systems," emphasizing AI advancements across infrastructure, data, and applications. Nadella highlighted breakthroughs in making computers understand and assist humans, driven by the rapid scaling of deep neural networks (DNNs). He compared the impact of AI to historical tech milestones, noting significant improvements in Microsoft's AI capabilities, including the rollout of Windows Copilot Runtime and enhancements to Azure's supercomputing power. Nadella also mentioned partnerships with Nvidia and AMD to optimize AI performance. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman echoed the sentiment, stressing that while AI is a powerful enabler, building great products and services still requires hard work.

# UK offers £8.5m for AI safety research grants
_Summarized by: David Chen_ [[www.uktech.news](https://www.uktech.news/ai/uk-ai-safety-research-grants-20240522)]

The UK government has announced £8.5 million in research grants for projects addressing AI-related risks, such as deepfakes and cyberattacks. Tech Secretary Michelle Donelan emphasized the importance of safely leveraging AI's potential across society. The funding, managed by the AI Safety Institute (AISI) in collaboration with UK Research and Innovation and the Alan Turing Institute, aims to foster partnerships between academia and industry. The AISI is also expanding internationally, with a new office in San Francisco. The announcement was made at the AI Seoul Summit, highlighting global cooperation on AI safety frameworks.

# Meta's global affairs president Nick Clegg: AI-generated election misinformation is minimal so far
_Summarized by: David Chen_ [[www.technologyreview.com](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/05/22/1092782/meta-says-ai-generated-election-content-not-happening-at-systemic-level/)]

Meta's global affairs president, Nick Clegg, stated at MIT Technology Review's EmTech Digital conference that AI-generated election misinformation is not occurring at a systemic level. Despite significant global elections, including in Indonesia, Taiwan, and Bangladesh, Meta observed minimal AI-generated misinformation. Clegg emphasized that while interference attempts exist, they are manageable. He defended Meta’s content moderation improvements since 2016, highlighting the removal of over 200 networks of coordinated inauthentic behavior. Meta is also labeling AI-generated images with visible markers and invisible watermarks. However, Clegg acknowledged the challenges in detecting AI-generated content, noting that current tools are still imperfect.

# Press conference on mind-controlled machines at ITU's AI for Good Global Summit 2024
