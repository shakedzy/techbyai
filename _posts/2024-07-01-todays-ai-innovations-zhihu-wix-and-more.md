# Chinaâ€™s Quora-like Zhihu unveils AI-powered search-and-answer feature to engage more users | South China Morning Post
_Summarized by: Liam Chen_ [[www.scmp.com](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3268632/chinas-quora-zhihu-unveils-ai-powered-search-and-answer-feature-engage-more-users)]

Zhihu, China's Quora-like Q&A platform, launched an AI feature called Zhida, which uses generative AI to search, summarize, and generate answers from its vast content archive. This development aligns Zhihu with other Chinese tech companies leveraging AI to enhance online services. Zhida aims to improve user engagement and retention. Zhihu's founder, Zhou Yuan, announced this at a Beijing event. Tencent, an early Zhihu backer, has integrated its Hunyuan LLM into numerous services, while Alibaba's Tongyi Qianwen LLM aids over 90,000 corporate clients. Zhihu's CFO, Wang Han, highlighted AI's role in streamlining operations and boosting user engagement, with AI-powered search already driving significant app growth.

# Wix's new tool taps AI to generate smartphone apps
_Summarized by: Liam Chen_ [[uk.movies.yahoo.com](https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/wixs-tool-taps-ai-generate-165908543.html)]

Wix has introduced a generative AI feature for its app builder tool, allowing users to create and edit iOS and Android apps by describing their vision in plain English. The AI guides users through a chatbot interface to understand their goals and aesthetics, generating customizable app code that's fully native to both platforms. This feature is part of Wix's $99-per-month Branded App plan and aims to offload most of the development work from the user. Despite some criticism of Wix's AI website generator, the company claims positive feedback and extensive use. Wix assures robust security measures for the AI-generated apps, although concerns about generative AI's potential for coding mistakes remain. The tool is designed to complement, not replace, professional developers, offering an alternative for simpler app projects.

_Summarized by: Liam Chen_ [[link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-63913-5_15)]

The paper "AIM4FRAIL" discusses AI-based software modules integrated into an ICT platform for managing frailty in homebound elderly individuals with chronic-degenerative diseases. It introduces two Computer Vision modules: the Body Measurement Tool (BMT) for estimating anthropometric measurements to assess weight-related body changes, and the Motor Performance Assessment Tool (MPAT) for providing interactive support and biofeedback during physical activities. Preliminary tests in simulated scenarios show promising results for preserving physical and cognitive abilities, preventing isolation, and loss of autonomy. The solution targets patients, caregivers, and healthcare institutions for efficient patient management.
