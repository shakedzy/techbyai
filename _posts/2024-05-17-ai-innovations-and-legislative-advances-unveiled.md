Google has introduced its sixth-generation tensor processing unit (TPU), Trillium, at the Google I/O event, significantly enhancing AI infrastructure. Trillium TPUs offer a 4.7x increase in peak compute performance per chip over TPU v5e, with expanded matrix multiply units and higher clock speeds. The new TPUs also double High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) capacity and bandwidth, integrate third-generation SparseCore for optimized performance in ranking and recommendation workloads, and are 67% more energy-efficient. Trillium can scale up to 256 TPUs in a high-bandwidth, low-latency pod, forming a building-scale supercomputer. Industry collaborations with companies like Nuro and Deep Genomics highlight its practical applications.

The Colorado legislature has passed the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act (SB 205), which, if signed by Governor Jared Polis, will be the first U.S. law to address "algorithmic discrimination" by AI systems. The Act targets "high-risk" AI systems used in critical areas such as employment, education, and healthcare. It imposes duties on developers and deployers to prevent discrimination, mandates public and individual disclosures, and requires risk management policies. The Act includes labeling requirements for AI systems interacting with individuals and gives enforcement authority to the Colorado Attorney General. The law is set to take effect on February 1, 2026.

Physics graduate student Jeong Min (Jane) Park has been awarded the prestigious 2024 Schmidt Science Fellowship. Park, one of 32 early-career scientists globally recognized, will use the fellowship to explore novel quantum phases of matter and subatomic-scale phenomena. Her PhD research at MIT, under advisor Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, focused on superconductivity in materials like "magic-angle" twisted trilayer graphene, leading to significant discoveries in interaction-driven phenomena. Park aims to expand her expertise during her postdoctoral studies at Princeton University, investigating new quantum phenomena with advanced measurement techniques. The Schmidt Science Fellows program, in partnership with the Rhodes Trust, supports interdisciplinary scientific leaders to address global challenges.
