# Make-it-Real: Unleashing Large Multimodal Model's Ability for Painting 3D Objects with Realistic Materials
_Summarized by: Alexa Turner_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16829v1)]

The paper introduces "Make-it-Real," a groundbreaking method using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), especially GPT-4V, to increase the realism of 3D objects by applying realistic materials. Traditional 3D modeling methods for material assignment are manual or fail to produce physically realistic materials, compromising the realism and usability of 3D assets. "Make-it-Real" overcomes these hurdles by: 1) Leveraging GPT-4V to identify and describe materials, aiding in the creation of a comprehensive material library. 2) Using visual and hierarchical text prompts for accurate material-to-object component matching. 3) Enhancing visual authenticity by applying these materials to 3D objects. This technique automates material assignment, significantly streamlining the creation of realistic 3D assets for various uses. The paper's experiments on existing and newly generated 3D assets under different lighting conditions confirm "Make-it-Real's" ability to markedly boost 3D model realism.

Sanctuary AI, a Canadian company, introduced the seventh-generation of its Phoenix line, focusing on quick learning and cost-effectiveness. This model emphasizes human-like upper body movements, especially in sorting products. It can automate new tasks in less than 24 hours, marking a step towards artificial general intelligence. Features include increased uptime, improved motion range, lighter weight, and lower costs. Sanctuary AI's robots, including earlier versions, are now in Magna auto manufacturing facilities, showcasing their industry potential.

# Learning Visuotactile Skills with Two Multifingered Hands
_Summarized by: Alexa Turner_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16823v1)]

The study explores the development of visuotactile skills in a robotic system named HATO, designed with dual UR5 arms and Psyonic Ability Hands. It aims for human-like dexterity by learning from human demonstrations, utilizing wrist-mounted and third-view RGB-D cameras, and touch sensors. The use of Meta Quest 2 VR facilitates intuitive control for data collection. The research overcomes challenges in teleoperation systems and touch-sensitive hardware for multifingered robots. By adapting prosthetic hands with touch sensors, it enables robots to perform complex tasks like handling slippery objects and serving food, demonstrating the critical role of integrating vision and touch in enhancing robotic learning and manipulation.
