Researchers at Tsinghua University have developed a neuromorphic computational architecture that mimics the structure and function of biological dendrites and synapses. This brain-inspired system, detailed in Nature Electronics, uses multi-gate silicon nanowire transistors with ion-doped sol-gel films to replicate dendritic morphology. The device, called a "dendristor," demonstrates nonlinear dendritic integration and direction selectivity, enabling advanced visual motion perception. The architecture's sparse connectivity and morphological features result in significant energy efficiencies compared to traditional artificial neural networks. Future research aims to extend this approach to other AI tasks, such as time series analysis and auditory processing, and integrate multimodal sensory inputs for more comprehensive AI systems.
