# Amazon Invests $4B to Advance Generative AI Tech to Customers
_Summarized by: Mia Wong_ [[aibusiness.com](https://aibusiness.com/companies/amazon-invests-4b-to-advance-generative-ai-tech-to-customers)]

Amazon has significantly expanded its investment in Anthropic, a company specializing in the development of large language models, by contributing an additional $2.75 billion. This investment boosts Amazon's total financial commitment to Anthropic to $4 billion, following an initial $1.25 billion investment. The collaboration is aimed at enhancing the deployment of advanced generative AI applications across various organizations globally. Swami Sivasubramanian, AWS's vice president of data and AI, highlighted the potential of generative AI as a transformative technology and expressed enthusiasm for the improvements this partnership could bring to customer experiences. Unlike other AI startups that rely on Nvidia chips for training AI models, Anthropic utilizes Amazon's AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips for its Claude models, offering feedback that influences Amazon's approach to AI workloads. Anthropic's models are accessible to businesses through Bedrock, Amazonâ€™s service providing foundation models via an API, already utilized by Delta Airlines, GoDaddy, Siemens, and in collaboration with Accenture to advance generative AI applications.

# Mali uses artificial intelligence for books in local language
_Summarized by: Alex Rivera_ [[www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/13/mali-books-artificial-intelligence-ai/)]

In Mali, a groundbreaking initiative uses AI to translate children's books into Bambara, the country's most spoken local language. Amidst political shifts and a move away from French, RobotsMali, a local startup, has produced over 140 books in Bambara, reflecting Malian life and culture. Leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Translate, this project supports language learning and cultural preservation. Supported by the Mali Education Ministry and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, it's shown promising results in improving children's reading skills in Safo, Mali.

# AI providing new tools to threat actors for attacks, says cybersecurity expert
_Summarized by: Alex Rivera_ [[www.dawn.com](https://www.dawn.com/news/1827209)]

The widespread adoption of AI technologies has empowered cyber attackers with sophisticated tools, Kaspersky Research reports. Deepfake technology, which generates convincingly human-like replicas, is sold on darknet marketplaces for as low as $300 per minute of video. This poses risks of fraud, identity theft, and data breaches. Despite 51% of surveyed employees in the Middle East, Turkiye, and Africa being able to theoretically identify deepfakes, only 25% succeeded in practice. Kaspersky's Hafeez Rehman highlights the threats deepfakes pose, including misinformation and impersonation scams, particularly in political arenas. The report emphasizes the need for increased awareness and protective measures against deepfakes.
