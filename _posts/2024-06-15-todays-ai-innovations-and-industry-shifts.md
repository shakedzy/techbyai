OpenAI is significantly expanding its lobbying team to influence AI regulation, growing from three members in early 2023 to 35, with plans to reach 50 by the end of 2024. This move comes as global governments seek to regulate AI, impacting OpenAI's innovation and commercialization efforts. The company aims to ensure AI benefits humanity, not just maximize profits. Despite its growth, OpenAI's lobbying expenditures lag behind tech giants like Meta and Google. OpenAI's lobbying focuses on shaping legislation like the EU's AI Act and opposing stringent regulations on pre-training data. Additionally, OpenAI appointed former NSA head Paul M. Nakasone to its board to enhance safety and security initiatives.

# Mistral AI Warns of Lack of Data Centres and Training Capacity in Europe
_Summarized by: Amara Patel_ [[www.euronews.com](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/06/14/mistal-ai-warns-of-lack-of-data-centres-training-capacity-in-europe)]

Mistral AI, a French start-up, has raised concerns about Europe's insufficient data centres and training capacity for AI models. Audrey Herblin-Stoop, Head of Public Affairs at Mistral AI, emphasized the urgent need for infrastructure and electricity to support AI development. Mistral AI benefited from EU supercomputers but warns of future access issues for others. Despite launching a large language model in partnership with Microsoft, the collaboration faces scrutiny from the European Commission. The European Court of Auditors and EU officials acknowledge Europe's lag behind the US and China in AI investment and infrastructure. Additionally, Mistral AI highlights the need for diverse language data to ensure relevance in non-English languages. The AI Act, set to regulate high-risk AI systems, will come into force in May 2025.

# OpenAI Appoints Former Top US Cyberwarrior Paul Nakasone to its Board of Directors
_Summarized by: Amara Patel_ [[apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/openai-nsa-director-paul-nakasone-cyber-command-6ef612a3a0fcaef05480bbd1ebbd79b1)]

OpenAI has appointed retired Army Gen. Paul Nakasone, former commander of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, to its board of directors. Nakasone will help protect OpenAI from sophisticated cyber threats. This move follows significant organizational changes at OpenAI, including the reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman after a brief ousting and the formation of a new safety and security committee. The committee will advise on critical safety decisions, replacing a previous team that disbanded after key members resigned. Nakasone's extensive experience in cybersecurity is expected to bolster OpenAI's defense against emerging threats.
