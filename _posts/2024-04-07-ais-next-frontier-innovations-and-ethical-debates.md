# Next-Gen AI: Advancing Watermarking, Algorithm Synthesis, and Diverse Applications
_Summarized by: Alex Morgan_ [[www.cs.umd.edu](https://www.cs.umd.edu/event/2024/04/phd-proposal-next-gen-ai-advancing-watermarking-algorithm-synthesis-and-diverse)]

In a groundbreaking PhD proposal at the University of Maryland, a comprehensive exploration into the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) focuses on enhancing security through innovative watermarking techniques, expanding algorithmic capabilities, and pioneering new approaches in creative image generation. The research introduces certified watermarking techniques to safeguard Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against intellectual property violations, marking a significant advancement in AI innovation protection. It also explores the potential of neural networks in complex problem-solving beyond traditional pattern recognition, thereby extending the boundaries of algorithmic synthesis. Furthermore, the thesis delves into novel territories of image generation with diffusion models, employing deterministic transformations to generate highly specific and contextually relevant imagery with minimal retraining. This approach not only enhances the flexibility and applicability of diffusion models but also opens new avenues for creative expression within generative AI. Through these investigations, the thesis significantly contributes to the fields of AI watermarking, algorithm learning capabilities, and creative image generation, laying a solid foundation for future advancements in artificial intelligence.

# Generative AI's Journey to Production Unveiled at Google Cloud
_Summarized by: Sam Taylor_ [[blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-production-google-cloud-next/)]

Generative AI is revolutionizing industries by enabling innovations like personalized healthcare, fraud detection in finance, and virtual try-on experiences in retail. However, transitioning these applications from prototype to production poses challenges, including real-time response, accuracy, scalability, and usage. NVIDIA and Google Cloud are addressing these through their partnership, highlighted at the Google Cloud Next event in Las Vegas. They offer a comprehensive platform covering the entire generative AI stack, from infrastructure to inference microservices. The collaboration includes the adoption of NVIDIA's Grace Blackwell platform by Google Cloud, enhancing performance and scalability for generative AI applications. Additionally, NVIDIA AI Enterprise software on Google Cloud Marketplace ensures optimized model performance with enterprise-grade security and support. The partnership aims to minimize costs and maximize effectiveness for generative AI projects, leveraging Google Cloud's global reach and scalable infrastructure.

# The Battle over AI Regulation Will End in a Big Fight over Transparency & Audits
_Summarized by: Riley Smith_ [[medium.com](https://medium.com/@AdamThierer/the-battle-over-ai-regulation-will-end-in-a-big-fight-over-transparency-audits-69007e9cd6c8)]

In the article, Adam Thierer discusses the challenges and implications of regulating artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on the contentious issue of transparency and audits. He argues that while the fight against overly restrictive regulations has been challenging, the real battle lies ahead with algorithmic transparency and "explainability." Thierer highlights the complexities of implementing transparency requirements, noting their potential to stifle innovation if not handled properly. He draws parallels with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), illustrating how well-intentioned transparency laws can lead to bureaucratic obstacles and delays. The article also covers the Biden Administration's efforts to push for AI auditing mandates and the potential establishment of a federal AI auditing regime. Thierer expresses concern over the impact of such regulations on innovation and the tech industry, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that avoids the pitfalls of European-style regulation. He concludes by questioning the feasibility of defining and enforcing algorithmic "explainability," warning of the potential for political interference and the undermining of competitive advantages.

# AI Ethics Series: AI and Bias - Silicon Flatirons
_Summarized by: Sam Taylor_ [[siliconflatirons.org](https://siliconflatirons.org/events/ai-ethics-series-ai-and-bias-2024-04-18/)]

The Silicon Flatirons Center, in collaboration with the Daniels Fund Ethics Initiative Collegiate Program and the Byron R. White Center, is hosting a pivotal lunch talk on "AI and Bias" on April 18, 2024. This event aims to enlighten legal professionals about generative AI's role in perpetuating biases within the legal system, emphasizing the importance of understanding and mitigating these biases to uphold ethical standards and ensure equal access to justice. The discussion will feature insights from Newton Campbell, focusing on AI's intersection with bias and cybersecurity; Christine Goodman, exploring how bias infiltrates the AI development process; and Spencer Overton, examining generative AI's threat to democracy and the rule of law. This interdisciplinary conversation is set to address the challenges and opportunities presented by generative AI in the context of law, highlighting the critical need for legal professionals to adapt to these technological advancements.
