# Embodied Instruction Following in Unknown Environments
_Summarized by: Sophia Turner_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11818v1)]

Enabling robots to follow human instructions in unknown environments is crucial for autonomous household systems. Traditional methods struggle as they rely on pre-known environments, which limits their practicality when objects and their locations change frequently. The paper proposes a new method for Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) that allows robots to efficiently explore unknown environments and generate feasible plans using existing objects to accomplish tasks.

This method uses a hierarchical framework with a high-level task planner and a low-level exploration controller. The high-level planner generates step-by-step plans based on the task and visual clues from the environment. The low-level controller predicts navigation and interaction actions to discover relevant objects and complete the tasks. A semantic representation map of the scene is constructed dynamically to align the goals of task planning and exploration.

The method leverages large language models (LLMs) for strong reasoning and generalization abilities. Experimental results show a 45.09% success rate in completing complex tasks like making breakfast or tidying rooms in large, realistic indoor scenes. This approach significantly outperforms conventional methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical, dynamic household environments.

IBM and The All England Lawn Tennis Club have introduced a new generative AI feature called "Catch Me Up" for Wimbledon, utilizing IBM's Granite LLM on the watsonx platform. This feature provides personalized player stories and analysis through pre and post-match player cards on wimbledon.com and the Wimbledon App. It offers AI-generated content based on user preferences, including performance analysis and match highlights. Additionally, the enhanced IBM Slamtracker will use generative AI for match previews and reviews. A survey by IBM and Morning Consult reveals that 55% of global tennis fans view AI positively in sports, prioritizing real-time updates, personalized content, and unique insights.

# Generative AI: The New Creative Director In Digital Advertising
_Summarized by: Liam Hayes_ [[www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/06/17/generative-ai-the-new-creative-director-in-digital-advertising/)]

The digital advertising landscape is evolving with generative AI, revolutionizing content creation, delivery, and optimization. Traditional ad creation was labor-intensive, involving human copywriters and designers. Now, AI accelerates this process by generating headlines, ad copy, visuals, and videos, allowing human creatives to focus on strategy and storytelling. AI also enhances personalization, dynamically tailoring ads based on user data and behavior. However, challenges include maintaining quality control, addressing ethical concerns like deepfakes and bias, and ensuring transparency. Best practices involve the RAGS framework (responsibility, accuracy, guidelines, strategy) to maximize AI's potential while ensuring brand consistency. Future advancements include multimodal AI, real-time relevance, agile language models, interactive content, and cross-channel campaign automation. Balancing AI's benefits with ethical considerations will be key to creating effective and responsible advertising.
