Apple is reportedly preparing to unveil a significant AI development at its WWDC in June, potentially a major overhaul of Siri. This new AI, possibly incorporating generative AI, aims to enhance Siri’s capabilities, making it more responsive and capable of handling complex tasks. Apple has acquired 32 AI companies, including DarwinAI, to bolster its AI technology. The company is also rumored to be negotiating deals with Google and OpenAI to integrate their AI models into its ecosystem. These advancements suggest a future where Siri can understand app contexts, perform web searches, and offer more natural interactions.

Jan Leike, a key safety researcher at OpenAI, resigned after the launch of GPT-4o, citing the company's prioritization of "shiny products" over safety. Leike, who was co-head of superalignment, expressed concerns about the declining emphasis on safety culture and processes. His departure follows that of Ilya Sutskever, another senior safety figure. Leike's resignation comes ahead of a global AI summit in Seoul. He highlighted the need for OpenAI to focus more on safety, social impact, confidentiality, and security for future models. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the need for improvement and committed to addressing these issues.

# Some A.I. Companies Face a New Accusation: 'Open Washing'
_Summarized by: Liam Patel_ [[www.nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/business/what-is-openwashing-ai.html)]

Some AI companies are being accused of "openwashing," a term used when companies disingenuously label their products as "open source" to gain favor. This debate has intensified as figures like Elon Musk have sued OpenAI, claiming it has strayed from its commitment to openness. The Biden administration is also evaluating the risks and benefits of open-source AI models. Advocates argue that open-source models are more equitable and safer, while critics fear they can be misused. The lack of a clear definition of "open source AI" complicates the issue, with organizations like the Linux Foundation warning that openwashing undermines true openness and the free sharing of knowledge.

# ElevenLabs Raises $80 Million for AI Voice Cloning Projects
_Summarized by: Aisha Johnson_ [[www.pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2024/elevenlabs-raises-80-million-for-ai-voice-cloning-projects/)]

Voice technology firm ElevenLabs has raised $80 million in a Series B funding round, elevating its valuation to $1.1 billion. The funds will be used to launch new products and enhance safety measures to ensure ethical AI development. New offerings include a dubbing studio for movies and a voice library marketplace where users can earn from AI versions of their voices. Despite the promising applications, there are concerns over misuse, such as fraud. To address this, ElevenLabs is developing detection tools, including an AI Speech Classifier to verify AI-generated audio content.

# Google expands its partnership with INSAIT
_Summarized by: Aisha Johnson_ [[insait.ai](https://insait.ai/google-expands-its-partnership-with-insait/)]

Google has expanded its partnership with INSAIT, the Institute for Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Technology in Sofia, Bulgaria, with a new investment exceeding $2 million. This funding includes over $1 million in cloud computing resources, providing access to Google Cloud’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for advanced AI research. Additionally, $1 million will fund PhD fellowships to attract top talent in the region. This initiative builds on Google's initial $3 million support in 2022 and aims to bolster AI research in Central and Eastern Europe, fostering a world-class research environment and high-tech economy in Bulgaria.

# Meta Launches AI Image Generation Updates for Ads
_Summarized by: Aisha Johnson_ [[web.swipeinsight.app](https://web.swipeinsight.app/posts/meta-launches-ai-image-generation-updates-for-ads-6111)]

Meta has launched AI updates for ads through its Advantage+ Creative feature, enabling custom adjustments for optimal results. These include text modifications, image brightness changes, image-to-video conversions, template applications, and music addition for Stories. A key component is the Image Generation AI, offering two options: "Images Featuring an Object," where users upload an object image for varied backgrounds, and "Images Inspired by Your Creative," generating new images based on an uploaded one. Users can add text overlays to these images and select preferred versions for ad rotation. This feature aids in overcoming creative bottlenecks, providing variety, efficiency, and personalized content for improved ad performance.
