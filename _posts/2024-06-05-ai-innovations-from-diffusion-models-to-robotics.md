# Guiding a Diffusion Model with a Bad Version of Itself
_Summarized by: Sophia Martinez_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02507v1)]

Researchers have developed a new method to improve the quality of images generated by diffusion models, which are AI systems that create images from random noise through a series of denoising steps. Traditionally, the classifier-free guidance (CFG) technique has been used to enhance these images by guiding the generation process with an unconditional model. However, CFG often reduces the diversity of the generated images and is limited to conditional generation, where the model is given specific prompts or labels.

The new method, called autoguidance, addresses these limitations by using a less-trained or smaller version of the same model for guidance instead of an unconditional model. This approach allows for better control over image quality without sacrificing diversity. The researchers found that this method significantly improves the performance of image generation on datasets like ImageNet, achieving record low Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores, which measure the quality of the generated images.

Autoguidance works by identifying and correcting errors in the main model's predictions, especially in regions where the model's capacity or training time is limited. This method can be applied to both conditional and unconditional models, making it a versatile tool for improving AI-generated images across various applications. The researchers plan to make their implementation and pre-trained models publicly available, enabling further advancements in the field of generative AI.

# RoboCasa: Large-Scale Simulation of Everyday Tasks for Generalist Robots
_Summarized by: Sophia Martinez_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02523v1)]

RoboCasa is a large-scale simulation framework designed to train robots for everyday tasks, particularly in kitchen environments. The framework includes a diverse array of assets and tasks to ensure comprehensive training. RoboCasa features 120 kitchen scenes and over 2,500 3D objects, created using generative AI tools. It supports various robot embodiments, including mobile manipulators and humanoid robots.

The simulation framework is built on four main pillars:
1. **Diverse Assets**: Over 150 object categories and numerous kitchen layouts and styles.
2. **Cross-Embodiment Support**: Compatibility with different types of robots.
3. **Diverse Tasks**: 100 tasks guided by large language models, covering basic and composite activities.
4. **Massive Training Datasets**: Over 100,000 trajectories generated through human demonstrations and automated methods.

RoboCasa aims to bridge the gap in robotic data scarcity by leveraging realistic physical simulations. It uses generative AI for creating diverse and realistic environments and tasks, which are crucial for training generalist robots. The framework includes high-quality human demonstrations and automated trajectory generation to expand datasets with minimal human effort.

Experiments show that using synthetically generated data improves the generalization and performance of robot learning. The framework also demonstrates the potential for simulation data to enhance real-world task performance, highlighting its utility in scaling robot learning efficiently.

# Parrot: Multilingual Visual Instruction Tuning
_Summarized by: Sophia Martinez_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02539v1)]

The paper introduces PARROT, a novel approach designed to address the limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in handling multiple languages effectively. Traditional MLLMs, like GPT-4V, often focus on aligning vision encoders with language models using supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This process, however, tends to degrade the models' performance in non-English languages due to the predominance of English-centric datasets.

PARROT addresses this issue by utilizing a method that aligns visual tokens with multilingual text inputs through textual guidance. It employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to enhance the alignment of visual and textual tokens across different languages. Specifically, PARROT uses cross-attention between visual features and text embeddings to condition visual tokens on diverse language inputs. The MoE module then selects the most relevant experts to convert these visual tokens into language-specific embeddings.

To evaluate its effectiveness, the authors introduce a new benchmark called the Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark (MMMB), which includes six languages and various categories of questions. PARROT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both MMMB and other multilingual benchmarks, outperforming existing models in several non-English languages.

The paper also highlights the scarcity of non-English multimodal data and proposes a semi-automatic approach to generate high-quality multilingual datasets. This involves translating English texts into other languages using GPT-4, followed by manual calibration to ensure accuracy.

Overall, PARROT represents a significant advancement in enhancing the multilingual capabilities of MLLMs, making them more inclusive and effective across different languages and cultural contexts.

Chinese humanoid robots are increasingly being deployed on auto assembly lines to enhance efficiency and reduce human involvement in repetitive tasks. UBTech's Walker S robot will be used at Dongfeng Liuzhou Motor for tasks such as inspecting seat belts and door locks, oil filling, and logistics. These robots aim to work alongside traditional automation equipment, addressing complex scenarios and improving overall production flexibility. The cost of these industrial robots is currently between $40,000 and $50,000, potentially reducing the need for human labor if costs decrease further. The Chinese humanoid robot sector, valued at 3.91 billion yuan in 2023, is expected to exceed 20 billion yuan by 2026. However, challenges like high development costs and lack of comprehensive regulations could hinder large-scale adoption. Despite this, the global market for humanoid robots is projected to grow significantly, with sales expected to reach $154 billion by 2035.
