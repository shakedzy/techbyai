# Researchers reduce bias in pathology AI algorithms and enhance accuracy
_Summarized by: Ethan Wright_ [[medicalxpress.com](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-04-bias-pathology-ai-algorithms-accuracy.html)]

In a groundbreaking study by Mass General Brigham, published in Nature Medicine on April 19, 2024, researchers have made strides in reducing bias in pathology AI algorithms using foundation models. Analyzing data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and EBRAINS, the study revealed performance disparities in diagnosing cancers across demographics, with traditional methods offering minimal bias mitigation. The introduction of self-supervised foundation models, trained on extensive datasets, demonstrated a decrease in these disparities by encoding a richer representation of histology images. Despite progress, gaps remain, underscoring the need for diverse datasets and evaluations to ensure equitable AI models in medicine. This study is a pivotal call to action for the development of AI systems that serve all patient groups fairly.
