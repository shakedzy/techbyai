# AI Regulation – Key Developments for Products Stakeholders
_Summarized by: Jordan Lee_ [[products.cooley.com](https://products.cooley.com/2024/04/09/ai-regulation-key-developments-for-products-stakeholders/)]

The recent blog post on Cooley's Productwise reveals three key AI regulatory developments in Europe. The European Parliament has provisionally approved the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), introducing a risk-based approach for AI systems. This Act, effective from May 2025, categorizes AI into tiers of risk and sets transparency and compliance standards. Additionally, discussions on the AI Liability Directive (AILD) have restarted, aiming to protect consumers by augmenting fault-based liability rules, thus heightening AI companies' litigation risks. In the UK, a bill advocating for stricter AI regulation than the current 'light-touch' approach has reached its second reading. It suggests creating a UK AI authority, mandates a designated AI officer in businesses, and outlines AI product and service supplier responsibilities. This indicates a potential shift towards more stringent AI regulation after the upcoming election.

# Southeast Asia needs to balance AI innovation and regulation
_Summarized by: Alexa Thompson_ [[eastasiaforum.org](https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/04/09/southeast-asia-needs-to-balance-ai-innovation-and-regulation/)]

Southeast Asia stands at a crucial juncture, seeking to harmonize AI innovation with essential regulation. Cindy Zheng and Albert Jehoshua Rapha spotlight the region's efforts to craft policies ensuring AI's safe, ethical use, and fostering innovation. The Philippines, during its 2026 ASEAN chairmanship, aims to introduce an AI regulatory framework to prevent technology misuse. While Singapore leads with significant AI initiatives, disparities in readiness and development exist among ASEAN members. Learning from the EU's AI Act critiques, ASEAN aspires to balance regulation to promote ethical, economic AI benefits without stifling innovation.
