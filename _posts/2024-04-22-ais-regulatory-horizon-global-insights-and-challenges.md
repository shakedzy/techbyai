# AI Tools for Patent Drafting: Limitations and Future Prospects
_Summarized by: Morgan Lee_ [[ipwatchdog.com](https://ipwatchdog.com/2024/04/21/ai-tools-patent-drafting-llms-will-likely-never-write-claims-well-humans/id=175437/)]

In today's article, Clint Mehall explores AI's role in patent drafting, focusing on claim writing. Despite generative AI's growth, Mehall believes it falls short of the nuanced expertise of human practitioners. He compares AI tools to novices, capable of structuring claims but lacking in-depth understanding. Precision in claim language is crucial, as minor wording changes can greatly affect patent lawsuits. While AI aids in mundane tasks, Mehall argues that claim drafting's nuanced work demands human skill and intuition. He advocates for human collaboration in patent drafting, highlighting the complexity AI cannot fully replicate.

# Sydney universities launch new database to combat fake news and misinformation
_Summarized by: Morgan Lee_ [[www.sydney.edu.au](https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2024/04/22/fake-news-misinformation-sydney-universities-launch-new-database.html)]

Researchers from the University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, and University of Technology Sydney have launched the International Digital Policy Observatory (IDPO). This innovative online database tracks digital policies and regulations across 50 countries, focusing on misinformation, AI regulation, online harms, cybersecurity, and digital identity. Aimed at academics, policymakers, and the ICT industry, the IDPO, funded by the Australian Research Council, seeks to foster knowledge sharing and regulatory best practices. Initially concentrating on misinformation, it aligns with the Draft Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill, with plans to broaden its scope.
