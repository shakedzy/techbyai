The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, particularly in critical care, is a groundbreaking evolution with the potential to significantly enhance Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). However, its ethical implementation and development pose unique challenges. Critical care situations often involve life-threatening conditions requiring swift actions, with patients unable to participate in decision-making. The development of AI-based CDSS must navigate complexities such as data acquisition biases, health disparities, domain shifts, and cognitive biases in decision-making. This necessitates a robust ethical framework, emphasizing the integration of 'Human-in-the-Loop' and 'Algorithmic Stewardship' principles, alongside the benefits of advanced data engineering. The establishment of Clinical AI Departments (CAID) is advocated to lead AI innovation in healthcare, ensuring ethical integrity and human-centered development in this rapidly evolving field. This approach aims to balance technological advancements with the preservation of human values and the complexities of clinical decision-making, ensuring AI serves as a tool for enhancement rather than replacement, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes and healthcare delivery.
