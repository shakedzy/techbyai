# Cutting-edge technology detects nanoplastics in water – instantly | Newsroom - McGill University
_Summarized by: Liam Carter_ [[www.mcgill.ca](https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/cutting-edge-technology-detects-nanoplastics-water-instantly-357890)]

A McGill-led research team has developed AI-Assisted Nano-DIHM, a groundbreaking technology capable of detecting nanoplastics in water in real-time. This innovation, utilizing nano digital in-line holographic microscopy, can differentiate nanoplastics from other particles instantly, addressing a critical need for accurate monitoring of plastic pollution. Nanoplastics, much smaller than microplastics, have been challenging to detect with existing methods. This technology, developed in collaboration with the National Research Council of Canada, represents a major advancement in environmental monitoring, offering practical tools for identifying pollution hotspots. Preliminary findings from Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River have shown its effectiveness.

# IMTS 2024 Conference: Worker-Centric Mobile Robot Integration: Unlocking Manufacturing Excellence - Aerospace Manufacturing and Design
_Summarized by: Liam Carter_ [[www.aerospacemanufacturinganddesign.com](https://www.aerospacemanufacturinganddesign.com/news/learn-about-mobile-robots-manufacturing-amd/)]

Recent advancements in mobile robot technology are making integration into manufacturing environments more accessible. The IMTS 2024 Conference presentation by KUKA Robotics emphasizes the importance of a worker-centric approach to automation. Manufacturing workers, as process champions, provide invaluable insights for successful automation. The presentation highlights the differences between stationary and mobile robots, stressing that mobile robots require deeper consideration of worker well-being and expertise. By merging technology with workforce expertise, the full potential of mobile robots can be unlocked while upholding respect and shared responsibility. The conference, managed by GIE Media, features 69 presentations on topics like process innovation, plant operations, and automation.

# How Companies Can Mitigate AI's Growing Environmental Footprint
_Summarized by: Ava Mitchell_ [[hbr.org](https://hbr.org/2024/07/how-companies-can-mitigate-ais-growing-environmental-footprint)]

As AI becomes more prevalent in business and governance, its environmental impact, including increased energy and water usage and higher carbon emissions, is significant. AI’s power demand is projected to rise by 160% by 2030. To mitigate these effects, companies can adopt sustainable practices such as using foundation models, optimizing data processing locations, investing in energy-efficient processors, and leveraging open-source collaborations. These strategies reduce AI’s environmental footprint while enhancing operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. By 2026, the computing power for AI training is expected to increase tenfold, further driving resource consumption.

# Synergy AI Scientist in the Helmholtz Foundation Model Initiative at MDC for Helmholtz Imaging – helmholtz-imaging.de
_Summarized by: Ava Mitchell_ [[helmholtz-imaging.de](https://helmholtz-imaging.de/news/synergy-ai-scientist-in-the-helmholtz-foundation-model-initiative-at-mdc-for-helmholtz-imaging/)]

The Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) in the Helmholtz Association is seeking a Synergy AI Scientist for the Helmholtz Foundation Model Initiative (HFMI). This role involves benchmarking self-supervised learning paradigms on large-scale scientific data to identify common patterns and derive best practices for foundation model development. The candidate should have an MSc in computer science, physics, or mathematics, a PhD with a machine learning focus, and experience with large-scale HPC. The MDC offers an international work environment, career opportunities, family support, flexible hours, and a health and fitness center. Applications are due by July 11, 2024.

# Can Hardware Development Keep Up with AI's Skyrocketing Capabilities? | Tech Times
_Summarized by: Ava Mitchell_ [[www.techtimes.com](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/306353/20240704/can-hardware-development-keep-up-with-ais-skyrocketing-capabilities.htm)]

The rapid advancements in AI, particularly with models like GPT-4, Claude 3, and Google's Gemini, have highlighted significant hardware demands. These sophisticated AI systems require immense computing power, which only a few corporations can afford, creating a barrier for smaller entities. The environmental impact is also concerning, with AI's electricity demand predicted to triple. A promising solution lies in distributed computing models, exemplified by Qubic, which leverages decentralized networks and blockchain technology to democratize access to AI. This approach not only addresses scalability but also reduces power concentration and enhances energy efficiency, fostering a more diverse AI ecosystem.

# Artificial intelligence: a central bank's view
_Summarized by: Ava Mitchell_ [[www.ecb.europa.eu](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2024/html/ecb.sp240704_1~e348c05894.en.html)]

Piero Cipollone, a member of the ECB's Executive Board, highlighted the transformative potential of AI in various sectors, including central banking. AI adoption is rapidly increasing, with significant impacts anticipated on productivity, labor markets, and financial stability. Cipollone emphasized the need for a European AI strategy to ensure competitive and broad-based AI integration. He also discussed AI's potential to enhance ECB tasks, such as economic analysis, statistics, and communication. However, he warned about the risks, including privacy concerns, misinformation, and over-reliance on AI, advocating for robust safeguards and human oversight to maintain trust and accountability.
