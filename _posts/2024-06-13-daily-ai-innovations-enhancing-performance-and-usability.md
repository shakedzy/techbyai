# AI-powered simulation training improves human performance in robotic exoskeletons
_Summarized by: Liam Rodriguez_ [[medicalxpress.com](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-06-ai-powered-simulation-human-robotic.html)]

Researchers at North Carolina State University have developed an AI and computer simulation method to train robotic exoskeletons, enhancing human mobility by reducing energy expenditure during activities like walking, running, and climbing stairs. This machine-learning framework eliminates the need for extensive human training and handcrafted control laws. In tests, participants using the exoskeletons showed significant reductions in metabolic energy consumption: 24.3% less for walking, 13.1% less for running, and 15.4% less for climbing stairs. The method aims to rapidly advance and broadly apply assistive robots, including those for mobility-impaired individuals.

# BlinqIO raises $5M to automate software testing using generative AI
_Summarized by: Liam Rodriguez_ [[siliconangle.com](https://siliconangle.com/2024/06/12/blinqio-raises-5m-automate-software-testing-using-generative-ai/)]

BlinqIO Inc., a startup specializing in generative AI for software testing, has secured $5 million in funding led by Flint Capital, with participation from Inovia Capital’s Precede Fund I. BlinqIO has developed an AI test automation engineer that autonomously creates and maintains test scripts, potentially replacing human test engineers. This tool, powered by a proprietary large language model, supports over 50 languages and aims to alleviate the software testing bottleneck, allowing developers to focus on higher-value tasks. The global software testing market is projected to exceed $15 billion by 2027, highlighting significant growth opportunities for BlinqIO.

# NVIDIA Sets New Generative AI Performance and Scale Records in MLPerf Training v4.0
_Summarized by: Liam Rodriguez_ [[developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/recent-posts/?learning_levels=Advanced+Technical)]

NVIDIA has set new records in generative AI performance and scale with the MLPerf Training v4.0 benchmarks. Their advancements span various applications, including code writing, storytelling, music composition, image creation, and video production. Additionally, NVIDIA is enhancing large language models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to accelerate enterprise AI. Their AI foundation model, VISTA-2D, is advancing cell segmentation and morphology analysis in genomics. NVIDIA's H200 Tensor Core GPUs and TensorRT-LLM have also set MLPerf LLM inference records. Other notable developments include innovative training techniques for diffusion models and applying Mixture of Experts (MoE) in LLM architectures. NVIDIA continues to push the boundaries of AI, making significant strides in both performance and practical applications.

# New breakthrough makes Generative AI economically viable for legal teams
_Summarized by: Liam Rodriguez_ [[www.jdsupra.com](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-breakthrough-makes-generative-ai-2661339/)]

A new breakthrough by Hanzo makes Generative AI economically viable for legal teams. Hanzo's innovative engineering reduces data analysis and review costs by a factor of ten. Instead of relying on large language models (LLMs) like Chat-GPT, Hanzo's Spotlight AI uses smaller models hosted on secure private cloud instances, optimizing performance and cost. The GB-based pricing model, rather than the token-based one, significantly lowers costs, making AI adoption feasible for legal teams. Efficient management ensures the LLM operates only when needed, aligning costs with usage. This approach opens new use cases in data discovery and compliance while reducing data discovery time by 90%.

Adobe has integrated generative AI into Photoshop, allowing users to create images from simple text prompts, similar to Midjourney and DALL-E. This makes Photoshop more accessible to untrained users, simplifying complex editing tasks. For instance, a demo showcased the creation of a detailed image using a four-word prompt, significantly reducing editing time. However, there are concerns about job displacement due to AI. To address this, Adobe introduced Content Credentials, a tool to verify AI-altered images, and adheres to ethical practices by training its AI on licensed images and compensating contributing artists.
