Investing in generative AI stocks has been lucrative, with a 20% rise in 2024 compared to Nasdaq's 15%. However, the future of these stocks is uncertain. The success hinges on the emergence of a "killer app" that compels users to pay for AI services, similar to how spreadsheets revolutionized PC use. Despite numerous experiments, companies face challenges like AI hallucinations and lack of product vision. Apple's failure to present a compelling AI application at its recent conference highlights the industry's struggle. Without a breakthrough application, the demand for generative AI products might wane, impacting stock performance.

# Overcoming AI's 5 Biggest Roadblocks
_Summarized by: David Rodriguez_ [[www.informationweek.com](https://www.informationweek.com/machine-learning-ai/overcoming-ai-s-5-biggest-roadblocks)]

AI development faces five major roadblocks: bias, governance, cost, skills, and data. Bias in AI can lead to unintended consequences for marginalized groups, necessitating mitigation throughout the AI lifecycle. Governance is complicated by evolving technologies and regulations, with many organizations unprepared for AI-related risks. High costs and fragmented workflows hinder AI accessibility, requiring unified IT investments to demonstrate AI's value. The skills gap is widening as educational systems lag behind rapid AI advancements, leaving graduates unprepared for real-world challenges. Finally, access to high-quality data remains a significant hurdle, with legacy data management issues complicating AI adoption.
