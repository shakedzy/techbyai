ESA's new Î¦sat-2 mission, set to launch in July 2024, aims to advance AI in Earth observation. The satellite, measuring 22 x 10 x 33 cm, features a multispectral camera and an AI computer for real-time image analysis. It will perform tasks such as cloud detection, street map generation, maritime vessel detection, image compression, marine anomaly detection, and wildfire detection. These AI applications enhance data processing efficiency and provide actionable insights. The mission, a collaboration between ESA and Open Cosmos, will launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9. The initiative underscores AI's transformative potential in space technology.

Apple has been granted a board observer role at OpenAI as part of their partnership announced during WWDC 2024. Phil Schiller, Apple's head of App Store development and former marketing chief, will fill this role. Although Schiller can attend OpenAI's board meetings, he cannot vote or influence decisions. This arrangement does not involve financial transactions, differentiating it from Microsoft's similar observer role. Apple aims to integrate ChatGPT with its operating systems and potentially earn revenue through App Store fees for OpenAI's services. Future partnerships with Google, Anthropic, and Chinese companies like Alibaba and Baidu are also being explored.
