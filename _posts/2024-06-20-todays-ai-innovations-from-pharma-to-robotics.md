# 14 Companies Pioneering AI Foundation Models in Pharma and Biotech
_Summarized by: David Zhang_ [[www.biopharmatrend.com](https://www.biopharmatrend.com/post/835-14-companies-pioneering-ai-foundation-models-in-pharma-and-biotech/)]

Foundation models are transforming AI in biotech, enabling applications across various economic functions. These large-scale machine learning models, often based on transformers, are trained on massive datasets. Notable examples include GPT-3, GPT-4, and BERT. Their scalability allows them to capture intricate data patterns, making them efficient in few-shot or zero-shot learning scenarios. Companies like Deep Genomics, Ginkgo Bioworks, and Bioptimus are pioneering domain-specific foundation models. Deep Genomics' BigRNA model aids RNA-based drug discovery. Ginkgo Bioworks partners with Google Cloud to develop genomics-focused models, and Bioptimus collaborates with Owkin to advance multi-omics cancer research.

Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder and former chief scientist of OpenAI, has launched a new AI company called Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI) with Daniel Gross and Daniel Levy. This move follows Sutskever's departure from OpenAI after disagreements over AI safety approaches. SSI aims to develop superintelligent AI systems with a strong focus on safety, addressing concerns about the potential risks of AI surpassing human intelligence. Unlike OpenAI, which started as a non-profit, SSI is structured as a for-profit entity. The company is based in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv and is currently recruiting technical talent.

Generative AI, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), is revolutionizing drug discovery by interpreting biological and chemical languages such as DNA sequences and protein structures. It enhances various stages of drug development, including target identification, lead generation, and optimization. AI models can analyze genomic data to pinpoint disease targets, generate novel compounds, and expedite large-scale screening processes, dramatically reducing time and costs. Companies like Insilico Medicine have leveraged AI to develop drugs faster and more affordably, exemplified by their work on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19 treatments. This technology promises a future of quicker, more efficient drug development, transforming healthcare outcomes globally.

Unitree's H1 humanoid robot has set a new speed record for full-size humanoid robots at 7.3 mph, surpassing the previous 5.5 mph record. The nearly 6-foot-tall, 100-pound robot features 3D lidar sensing and a depth camera for autonomous navigation. Initially teased last summer, H1 showcases Unitree's advancements in humanoid and quadruped robots, including the Go2 quadruped with 4D lidar for multi-terrain navigation and the B2 industrial quadruped, noted for its speed and load capacity. Unitree's innovations highlight the potential of "embodied AI" in robotics.

# 3 ways to harness the power of generative AI for the energy transition
_Summarized by: David Zhang_ [[www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/emerging-technologies-03402c4cf4/)]

The World Economic Forum's website features a diverse range of articles covering topics from emerging technologies to climate action. Recent highlights include the annual Energy Transition Index, which identifies four leading countries in energy transition, and UNICEF's call to address severe food poverty affecting 180 million children. Health updates include the CDC monitoring bird flu and a new WHO report on non-communicable diseases. A New York City initiative addressing youth mental health and the FBI's dismantling of a massive botnet network are also featured. Additionally, articles discuss the importance of responsible AI, gender health gaps, and the role of generative AI in energy transitions.

# Is Gen AI Creating A Divide Among Law Firms Of Haves and Have Nots?
_Summarized by: David Zhang_ [[www.lawnext.com](https://www.lawnext.com/2024/06/is-gen-ai-creating-a-divide-among-law-firms-of-haves-and-have-nots.html)]

The article explores the growing divide in the adoption of generative AI between large and small law firms. While larger firms are increasingly integrating generative AI into their workflows, smaller firms lag behind due to limited resources and expertise. This disparity is exacerbated by the high costs and complexity associated with generative AI tools, which are often tailored to meet the needs of larger firms. The author suggests that bar associations and vendors catering to smaller firms should provide more resources and training to bridge this gap. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with smaller firms to explore and adopt these technologies to remain competitive.
