Companies facing new AI fairness regulations, such as those from the EU AI Act and U.S. state laws, often lack the demographic data needed for bias testing. This webinar, featuring experts from CDT, NIST, and other organizations, will address how to overcome these challenges. Topics include the impact of demographic data gaps, state-of-the-art data imputation techniques, and the pros and cons of data imputation versus collection. The panel will also provide guidance for policymakers and practitioners. Key speakers include Miranda Bogen, Reva Schwartz, Myriah Jaworski, Chris Cooksey, and Philip Dawson.

# Babies Use 'Helpless' Infant Period to Learn Powerful Foundation Models, Just Like ChatGPT
_Summarized by: Sofia Patel_ [[www.sciencedaily.com](https://www.sciencedaily.com/news/mind_brain/educational_psychology/)]

ScienceDaily's Educational Psychology section covers a range of recent research. Notable highlights include a study showing low vitamin B6 levels negatively impact brain performance, and another finding that just thinking about a location activates mental maps in the brain. Online professional education proves effective for complex topics like quantum information science. Research indicates that babies use their postnatal 'helpless' period to develop powerful foundation models similar to those in generative AI. Additionally, there are findings linking higher blood pressure in adolescents to poorer cognitive functions and a study revealing that improving AI large language models helps align them better with human brain activity.
