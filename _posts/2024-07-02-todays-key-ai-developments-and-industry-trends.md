_Summarized by: Sophia Zhang_ [[www.cio.com](https://www.cio.com/article/2511399/despite-adoption-hurdles-healthcare-is-all-in-on-generative-ai.html)]

Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly gaining traction in healthcare, impacting areas such as hospital operations, clinical trials, and drug discovery. The 2024 Generative AI in Healthcare Survey reveals significant budget increases, with technical leaders driving adoption. Large companies lead in evaluating GenAI, while medium and small companies experiment with and develop models. Task-specific language models are preferred, reflecting the sector's unique needs. Common applications include answering patient questions, medical chatbots, and information extraction. Despite the enthusiasm, challenges like accuracy, privacy, and ethical concerns necessitate human oversight. Tailored strategies and collaboration between technical experts and domain specialists are essential for successful GenAI implementation in healthcare.

# United States - Music and the Arts - Major Labels File Suit Against AI Music Start-Ups For Unlicensed Training
_Summarized by: Liam O'Reilly_ [[www.mondaq.com](https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/music-and-the-arts/1485430/major-labels-file-suit-against-ai-music-start-ups-for-unlicensed-training)]

On June 24, 2024, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment filed copyright infringement lawsuits against AI music start-ups Suno and Udio. These companies allow users to generate music based on text prompts using AI models trained on copyrighted recordings without permission. The lawsuits claim that the AI-generated outputs contain components identical to copyrighted materials, citing examples like Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. Goode" and Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You." The labels seek declarations of infringement, injunctions, and statutory damages. Suno's CEO defended their technology as transformative, arguing it generates new outputs rather than copying existing content.

# AI in the Workplace: The New Legal Landscape Facing US Employers
_Summarized by: Sophia Zhang_ [[www.morganlewis.com](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2024/07/ai-in-the-workplace-the-new-legal-landscape-facing-us-employers)]

Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the employment landscape by automating tasks and enhancing decision-making. However, it raises concerns about biases, accuracy, and legal compliance. The U.S. government, from the Biden administration to local governments, has introduced regulations to govern AI use in workplaces. Employers are using AI to streamline recruiting and promote diversity, but risks include potential discrimination and data leaks. The White House has issued guidelines to protect workers, emphasizing transparency, ethical AI development, and safeguarding workers' rights. States like New York, Colorado, and California have implemented or proposed AI regulations, focusing on bias audits, transparency, and compliance. Employers should adopt transparent AI usage policies, validate AI results, and stay informed on legislation to mitigate legal risks.

# Tesla’s Robotaxis Coming in 2024, Full Self-Driving Feature in 2023 | IoT World Today
