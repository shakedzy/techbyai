European Union lawmakers have passed a landmark AI regulation that sets a global precedent. The legislation aims to regulate AI across sectors like healthcare and law enforcement, banning uses deemed "unacceptable" such as social scoring systems and AI tools predicting race, political views, or sexual orientation. High-risk applications, particularly in education, hiring, and government services, will face stringent requirements for transparency and accountability. Companies developing complex AI systems must label AI-generated content to prevent misinformation. This proactive EU approach contrasts with the slower progress of comprehensive AI legislation in the United States.

Researchers from the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that publicly available AI voice-cloning tools can easily create convincing election lies using the voices of well-known political figures. In tests involving 240 attempts, 80% produced believable fake audio, including false claims by figures like Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron. The study highlighted a significant lack of safeguards against AI-generated election disinformation, with most tools having easily bypassed barriers. Only ElevenLabs showed some resistance by blocking cloning of U.S. and U.K. politicians, but it still allowed EU politicians' voices to be cloned. Experts urge stricter regulations and transparency from AI companies to prevent misuse in upcoming elections.

Saudi Arabia's Prosperity7 fund, part of state-owned Saudi Aramco, has become the sole foreign investor in Zhipu AI, a Chinese generative AI startup aiming to rival OpenAI. This move highlights Saudi Arabia's intention to counter Silicon Valley's dominance in AI. Zhipu AI, China's largest generative AI startup by staff, has previously relied on local investments and government support due to increasing US restrictions on AI technology and chips. The US has been tightening measures to limit China's access to advanced AI hardware, prompting Chinese companies to seek domestic alternatives. This Saudi investment signifies a strategic alliance to bolster China's AI capabilities amidst ongoing US-China tech tensions.
