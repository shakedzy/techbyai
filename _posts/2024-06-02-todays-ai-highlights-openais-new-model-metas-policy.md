OpenAI has started training a new flagship AI model aimed at achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), capable of performing any task a human brain can. Robotics experts believe scaling existing network architectures with large datasets might lead to general-purpose robots that can operate in diverse environments. Despite the hype around the latest ChatGPT, many of its new features are not yet available. Scientists have created the world's thinnest lens, just three atoms thick. Google's AI Overviews are being improved to reduce incorrect answers. Researchers are exploring 1-bit LLMs to address AI's energy demands. A new AR laptop, Spacetop G1, offers a 100-inch virtual workspace. Ethical considerations are crucial as new technologies like AI and genetic engineering advance.

# Next-level AI: does the rise of artificial general and super-human intelligence levels beyond AI as we currently know require a complete re-think of intellectual property and the IP system
_Summarized by: Liam Carter_ [[www.worldtrademarkreview.com](https://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/article/next-level-ai-does-the-rise-of-artificial-general-and-super-human-intelligence-mark-the-end-of-ip)]

Intelligence levels beyond current AI will necessitate a fundamental rethinking of intellectual property (IP) systems. The rise of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and super-human intelligence could challenge the existing frameworks of IP, potentially rendering them obsolete. This shift would require legal and regulatory adaptation to address the complexities introduced by such advanced AI capabilities. The article emphasizes the need for proactive measures to anticipate and manage the implications of these technological advancements on IP law, ensuring that the system remains relevant and effective in the face of transformative AI developments.

# Meta's collection of generative AI features and experiences
_Summarized by: Ava Mitchell_ [[arstechnica.com](https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/facebook-meta-ai-%E2%80%93-objection-to-new-policy-of-using-user-content-to-train-meta-ai.1501031/)]

Facebook, now Meta, is updating its privacy policy on June 26, 2024, to use user content for training its AI models, including Meta AI and AI Creative Tools. This change, based on "legitimate interests," allows users to object to the use of their data. One user expressed strong objections, citing privacy, copyright, and GDPR concerns. They submitted a formal objection, which was immediately honored, suggesting Meta might be rushing to train AI before regulatory changes. The user advises others to object and report to GDPR authorities to strengthen potential legal actions. US users, however, may not have the option to opt-out.

# Anthropic's Claude Lets Businesses Create AI Helpers
_Summarized by: Ava Mitchell_ [[www.pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2024/anthropics-claude-lets-businesses-create-ai-helpers-from-scratch/)]

Anthropic has introduced a new feature for its AI assistant, Claude, allowing businesses to create custom AI helpers. This tool aims to enhance customer support and operational processes by automating tasks like order cancellations, database access, and providing real-time information. Julia McCoy, AI president of Content at Scale, believes this feature will significantly improve customer service efficiency and profitability. However, integrating Claude's capabilities with existing systems poses challenges, such as creating accurate tool descriptions. Despite these hurdles, the industry recognizes Anthropic's efforts to make AI tools more accessible and user-friendly, potentially transforming customer service through AI.

# Google's A.I. Search Leaves Publishers Scrambling
_Summarized by: Ava Mitchell_ [[www.nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/technology/google-ai-search-publishers.html)]

Google's overhaul of its search engine to include AI-generated summaries has left publishers worried. The new feature, AI Overviews, compiles content from news sites and blogs, displaying it at the top of search results. Media executives, such as Frank Pine of Media News Group and Tribune Publishing, fear it will reduce traffic to their sites. While publishers rely on Google for traffic, they are frustrated that their content is being used in a way that could undermine their revenue. Some are considering blocking Google's web crawler, but this could also reduce clicks. This has led to calls for government intervention to protect original content creators.

# Research could pave the way for a prosthetic hand and robot to be able to feel touch like a human hand
_Summarized by: Liam Carter_ [[www.sciencedaily.com](https://www.sciencedaily.com/news/computers_math/artificial_intelligence/)]

Researchers are developing innovative AI and computer vision systems inspired by human and animal biology. One approach mimics children's visual experiences to enhance object recognition and navigation in AI. Another combines bio-inspired cameras with AI to significantly improve pedestrian and obstacle detection for drivers. AI-driven concierge services are also emerging, promising enhanced customer interactions in hospitality. Additionally, engineers have created AI headphones that isolate a single speaker in a crowd by analyzing visual cues. These advancements highlight the diverse applications of bio-inspired AI and computer vision, from improving safety and convenience to enhancing user experiences in various settings.

# Early Adopters Of Gen AI In Law
_Summarized by: Liam Carter_ [[www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomdavenport/2024/06/01/early-adopters-of-gen-ai-in-law/)]

Generative AI is poised to significantly impact the legal profession by automating tasks like contract creation and legal research, but it also poses risks due to potential misinformation. Early adopters like A&O Shearman and Wilson Sonsini are leading the way. A&O Shearman has integrated AI into its operations, enhancing productivity but also encountering challenges like AI hallucinations. Wilson Sonsini has invested in AI for years, developing tools like Neuron for automated contract review. Both firms emphasize the need for human oversight and are actively innovating to stay ahead. Despite the slow adoption in the legal industry, these firms demonstrate the potential and challenges of integrating AI into legal practice.
