Researchers from Shanghai University have developed the "Correction and Planning with Memory Integration" (CPMI) framework, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance robot efficiency in complex tasks. Traditionally dependent on explicit programming, robots often struggled with unexpected challenges. The CPMI framework integrates memory and planning capabilities, allowing robots to adapt and learn from experiences in real-time. This approach enables robots to break down complex instructions, plan effectively, and correct their actions in response to obstacles. Tested in the ALFRED simulation environment, CPMI outperformed existing models, demonstrating higher success rates and improved task adaptability. The framework’s memory module mimics human memory, enhancing efficiency and adaptability over time. Potential applications span from household assistance to industrial automation, with ongoing refinements aimed at further enhancing memory capabilities and testing in diverse environments.

Singapore's AI Verify Foundation and Infocomm Media Development Authority released a Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI (GenAI Framework) on May 30, 2024. This framework, developed after public consultation, addresses accountability, data quality, trusted development, incident reporting, testing, security, content provenance, and R&D investment. It emphasizes the importance of responsible practices throughout the AI development chain, transparent data usage, and the need for industry best practices. While not mandatory, the framework encourages businesses to adapt its guidelines based on specific use cases and associated risks. Compliance with other applicable laws remains necessary.

OpenAI is resuming its robotics research group, applying generative AI to tasks such as manipulation. The San Francisco-based company, known for ChatGPT, had paused its robotics efforts in July 2021. The revival follows increased interest in generative AI and its applications in robotics, highlighted by the integration of large language models (LLMs) with physical robots. OpenAI is currently hiring for a research robotics engineer to train multimodal robotics models and improve core models. The company has also invested in humanoid developer Figure AI, signaling its renewed focus on robotics.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has launched the Assessing Risks and Impacts of AI (ARIA) program, inviting AI developers to submit their models for risk assessment. The initiative aims to refine AI testing methodologies and provide feedback to enhance model safety and robustness. ARIA 0.1, the inaugural program, focuses on large language models and involves three layers of evaluation: general model testing, red teaming, and large-scale field testing. The program builds on NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, developed to foster trustworthy AI systems. Interested developers can join the ARIA mailing list for more information.
