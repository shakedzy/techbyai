# Google Reportedly Moving DeepMind From Research to AI Products
_Summarized by: Liam O'Connor_ [[ramaonhealthcare.com](https://ramaonhealthcare.com/google-reportedly-moving-deepmind-from-research-to-ai-products/)]

Google is reportedly transitioning DeepMind from a research-focused entity to one centered on AI products, causing frustration among employees. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, Google's AI "super-unit" aims to enhance commercial AI products and conduct AI research. The merger leverages Google's vast AI expertise, as highlighted by DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis. However, some researchers feel constrained by top-down guidelines, with two sources mentioning increased pressure. This shift reflects Google's broader strategy to integrate AI innovations into its product lineup, despite internal growing pains.

# Developments Toward Standardizing AI 'Red Teaming'
_Summarized by: Liam O'Connor_ [[www.jdsupra.com](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/developments-toward-standardizing-ai-9288866/)]

AI “red teaming” involves simulating attacks on AI systems to identify vulnerabilities and improve security, becoming crucial as frameworks like the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) stress its importance. Some AI vendors require red teaming for indemnification benefits. However, the absence of standardized practices leads to inconsistent methodologies and hampers objective safety assessments. Anthropic's recent research highlights various red teaming methods and policy recommendations. Standardizing these methods is vital for managing current risks and future threats. Regulatory developments, such as NIST's Assessing Risks and Impacts of AI (ARIA) program, are essential to watch for implementing AI red teaming best practices.
