# Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Time Series Analysis
_Summarized by: Alexandra Pierce_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08790v1)]

This paper explores the use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series forecasting, particularly in predicting satellite traffic. KANs, inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, utilize spline-parametrized univariate functions instead of traditional linear weights. This allows KANs to dynamically learn activation patterns. The authors demonstrate that KANs outperform conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in forecasting tasks, providing more accurate results with fewer parameters.

Time series forecasting is crucial in fields like finance, medicine, and meteorology, where predicting future values based on past data is essential. Traditional methods like ARIMA and exponential smoothing have been widely used but are limited in handling complex, non-linear relationships. Modern approaches using Machine Learning (ML), especially Deep Learning (DL), have shown significant improvements.

KANs offer a novel approach by leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, which states that any continuous multivariate function can be represented as a composition of simpler univariate functions. This makes KANs highly efficient and interpretable. The paper evaluates KANs' performance on real-world satellite traffic data, showing that they provide better accuracy and efficiency compared to MLPs. The study highlights the potential of KANs in advanced neural network design for time series forecasting, although further research is needed to explore their robustness and compatibility with other deep learning architectures.

# Harnessing the power of longitudinal medical imaging for eye disease prognosis using Transformer-based sequence modeling
_Summarized by: Alexandra Pierce_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08780v1)]

The paper presents a novel AI model called Longitudinal Transformer for Survival Analysis (LTSA) designed to predict the progression of eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Traditional methods only analyze single images to determine the presence of disease at the time of imaging. In contrast, LTSA utilizes sequences of images taken over time, thus enabling it to forecast the future risk of developing these diseases.

LTSA uses a Transformer-based approach, which is typically used for processing sequences in natural language processing, to handle the irregular intervals between eye exams. The model incorporates temporal positional encoding to account for the time elapsed between visits, allowing it to learn from the entire sequence of images rather than just the most recent one.

The study validated LTSA using two large datasets: the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) for AMD and the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) for POAG. Results showed that LTSA significantly outperformed models that only considered single images. It provided more accurate and dynamic risk assessments, crucial for early intervention and treatment planning.

This approach not only improves predictive accuracy but also offers insights into which past images contribute most to the prognosis, making it a valuable tool for clinicians.
