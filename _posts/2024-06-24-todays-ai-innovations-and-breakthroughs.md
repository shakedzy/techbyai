Xiaoqi, a humanoid robot created by Ex-Robots, has captivated attendees at the 2024 World Intelligence Expo in Tianjin, China. Designed with enhanced facial expressions and the ability to foster emotional connections, Xiaoqi represents a significant advancement in AI and robotics. Ex-Robots currently produces 400-500 units per year, primarily for museums and educational institutions. The expo also featured UBTECH's Walker X, a humanoid robot capable of performing various tasks. Industry experts predict a substantial market for humanoid robots, with potential applications in households and elderly care. Despite challenges like battery life and cost, the global market could reach $154 billion by 2035.

Bill Schubart's opinion piece discusses the mental health crisis, attributing it to the influence of cellphones, social media, and artificial intelligence. He highlights alarming statistics, such as high rates of mental illness and suicide among youth, and critiques the extensive use of smartphones by children. Schubart contrasts todayâ€™s digital consumption with his own limited TV exposure as a child. He warns of the dangers of unrestricted online access, including sextortion and drug overdoses. Schubart also questions the efficacy of pharmaceuticals over psychotherapy and dietary changes. He concludes by urging society to balance corporate profits with community well-being through regulatory policies.
