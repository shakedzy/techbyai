Japan is expected to face labor shortages in 2024 due to new overtime regulations for truck drivers, which limit their working hours. These regulations aim to improve working conditions but are likely to disrupt supply chains. The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) suggests that automation and robotics could address these challenges. By automating tasks such as loading and unloading cargo, mobile robots could save truck drivers 25% of their working time and reduce errors. The adoption of service robots is anticipated to be a global trend, with significant growth in the transportation and logistics sectors.
