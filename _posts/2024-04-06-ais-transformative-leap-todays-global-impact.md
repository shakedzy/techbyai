# European approach to artificial intelligence | Shaping Europe's ...
_Summarized by: Alex Reed_ [[digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-approach-artificial-intelligence)]

Europe's approach to artificial intelligence (AI) is characterized by a dual focus on fostering excellence and ensuring trust. The European Union (EU) aims to become a global leader in AI by promoting research, industrial capacity, and the deployment of AI technologies that are safe and uphold fundamental rights. In April 2021, the European Commission unveiled its AI package, which included a communication on fostering a European approach to AI, a review of the Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence, and a regulatory framework proposal for AI. To further support AI innovation, especially among startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the Commission launched an AI innovation package in January 2024. This package aims to develop trustworthy AI that aligns with EU values and includes the strategic investment framework "GenAI4EU" to encourage the use of generative AI across the EU's strategic industrial ecosystems. The EU's commitment to excellence in AI is backed by substantial investments, including €1 billion per year from Horizon Europe and Digital Europe programmes, with an overall goal of reaching €20 billion in annual investments during the digital decade. Furthermore, the EU has proposed a legal framework to address AI-related risks, establishing clear rules based on different levels of risk and introducing dedicated rules for general-purpose AI models. These initiatives underscore the EU's dedication to leading in the development of cutting-edge, trustworthy AI technologies.

Among the new terms are data augmentation, knowledge representation, and deep fakes, reflecting the evolving landscape of AI technology.

Additionally, the newly announced research alliance, AI for Public Good, aims to leverage EU-U.S. scientific cooperation to advance research in areas such as energy optimization, emergency response, and extreme weather forecasting. This initiative underscores the commitment to applying AI systems for societal benefit.

The collaboration also plans to focus on tangible outcomes, including benchmarks and harmonizing regulatory approaches for AI technologies. This aligns with the EU’s AI Act, a comprehensive legal framework for AI deployment, emphasizing the importance of a unified approach to AI governance. The partnership between the U.S. and EU is expected to drive standards development and ensure competitiveness in the global economy, highlighting the critical role of AI in economic and national security.

# What Lies Ahead for Cybersecurity in the Era of Generative AI?
_Summarized by: Mia Zhang_ [[www.itsecurityguru.org](https://www.itsecurityguru.org/2024/04/05/what-lies-ahead-for-cybersecurity-in-the-era-of-generative-ai/)]

Generative AI (GenAI) is revolutionizing cybersecurity, presenting both new opportunities and enhanced risks. As GenAI infiltrates various sectors, its impact on cybersecurity is profound, offering sophisticated tools for both protection and attack. Cyber threats have evolved, with GenAI enabling more complex malware attacks, data breaches, and phishing scams. These attacks are more difficult to detect as they target specific vulnerabilities and mimic human communication more convincingly.

To counter these threats, cybersecurity strategies are adapting. The Zero Trust Framework, emphasizing continuous verification, along with Risk-Adaptive Protection and Data Loss Prevention technologies, are becoming essential. Furthermore, GenAI is not only a tool for attackers but also a powerful ally for cybersecurity defenses. It offers proactive threat detection, stopping attacks before they occur, and enhances security measures like encryption and password generation.

The cybersecurity landscape is in a state of flux, with GenAI at its core. As the technology evolves, so too must the approaches to securing digital assets. Awareness and adaptation are key, with the potential to leverage GenAI for more robust cybersecurity defenses. The future of cybersecurity in the era of GenAI is a balanced battlefield, where the technology's applications will determine its impact on security.

# The Amazing Ways IKEA Is Using Generative AI
_Summarized by: Alex Reed_ [[www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/04/05/the-amazing-ways-ikea-is-using-generative-ai/)]

IKEA is revolutionizing the customer experience and streamlining operations by harnessing the power of generative AI. The global furniture retailer has introduced a generative AI chatbot, powered by ChatGPT, to serve as a personal design assistant for customers. This AI tool, initially launched in the US, offers product information, personalized design suggestions, and integrates with IKEA Kreativ, allowing users to visualize and design their living spaces in a mixed-reality environment. Customers can now replace existing furniture in virtual room scans with new items, receive styling advice, and explore numerous design options tailored to their preferences.

Beyond enhancing customer interactions, IKEA is applying AI to improve operational efficiency and sustainability. The company uses AI to optimize delivery routes, monitor warehouse inventory with drones, and forecast consumer demand patterns. Notably, IKEA Portugal has improved demand forecasting accuracy by five percent. In Tianjin, China, Autonomous Mobile Robots are being tested for more efficient and sustainable warehouse operations.

IKEA is committed to ethical AI deployment, establishing a task force to ensure technology benefits customers while minimizing harm. The company prioritizes human-centric values, fairness, inclusiveness, and privacy, underlined by a digital ethics policy. To prepare its workforce for future challenges, IKEA has initiated an AI literacy program aiming to train 3,000 staff in ethical and responsible AI use in 2024, emphasizing the need for significant reskilling to adapt to tomorrow's job landscape.

# Major AI research breakthrough helps AI's forget copyrighted content ...
_Summarized by: Alex Reed_ [[www.fanaticalfuturist.com](https://www.fanaticalfuturist.com/2024/03/major-ai-research-breakthrough-helps-ais-forget-copyrighted-content/)]

Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin have achieved a significant breakthrough in AI research by developing a method for "Machine Unlearning," which allows AI systems to effectively forget copyrighted content. This innovation addresses a major challenge in the AI field, where previously, AI models retained "memories" of their training data, making it difficult to remove copyrighted or undesirable information without starting from scratch. The new method, particularly relevant for image-based Generative AI, enables the selective removal of problematic data, such as violent images or copyrighted works, without compromising the integrity of the remaining data. This advancement is crucial in light of recent legal actions, such as The New York Times and several artists suing OpenAI for copyright infringement. The ability to ensure AI models do not violate copyright laws or misuse personal information is vital for their commercial application. The research focuses on image-to-image models, which are trained to transform input images based on given instructions. The machine unlearning algorithm allows for the removal of flagged content by human moderation teams without retraining the model. This development represents a significant step forward in creating responsible and legally compliant AI systems.
