# The Impact of AI Will Only be On Mediocre Jobs, Says Yann LeCun
_Summarized by: Sam Taylor_ [[cryptorank.io](https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/95926-impact-of-ai-on-mediocre-jobs-yann-lecun)]

Yann LeCun, Meta's Chief AI Scientist, believes AI will mainly affect repetitive jobs, not creative or complex roles. At the World Economic Forum, he said AI doesn't threaten jobs in writing, teaching, therapy, law, athletics, or art. LeCun dismissed AI fearmongering, noting we're far from machines outsmarting humans. He called for workforce adaptation, akin to changes brought by the printing press and the internet. LeCun also doubted the feasibility of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), suggesting human intelligence isn't fully general. Advocating for open AI research, he proposed expanding learning inputs beyond text for AI to gain a more nuanced understanding, similar to humans or animals.
