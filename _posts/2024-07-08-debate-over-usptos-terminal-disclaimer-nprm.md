# Supporters of Life Sciences Innovation Spar with Drug Pricing Advocates in Comments to Terminal Disclaimer NPRM
_Summarized by: Lila Thompson_ [[ipwatchdog.com](https://ipwatchdog.com/2024/07/07/supporters-life-sciences-innovation-spar-drug-pricing-advocates-comments-terminal-disclaimer-nprm/id=178606/)]

The article discusses the debate over the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s (USPTO) proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on terminal disclaimers. Industry stakeholders, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and intellectual property strategist Robert Armitage, argue that the NPRM could harm life sciences innovation by limiting continuation patents and is outside the agency’s regulatory authority. They assert that the proposed changes rely on flawed data and contradict statutory mandates. Conversely, advocates like the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing support the NPRM, claiming it will address high drug prices by curbing excessive patenting. The article highlights the polarized views and the potential impact on patent prosecution costs.

Paul Hatton describes his experience using the Sololearn app to learn AI-generative tools. After initially struggling with traditional learning methods during his computer science degree, Paul found Sololearn to be a refreshing alternative. The app offers AI courses with interactive lessons, real-time feedback, and motivational features like streak tracking. Sololearn also includes engaging games like 'Bug Hunter' and community challenges, enhancing the learning process. Despite some limitations, such as the lack of direct communication with opponents during challenges and no AI prompt learning in the Code Playground, Paul believes Sololearn could have significantly enhanced his university studies.

# FreeBSD Contributor Mocks Gloomy Predictions for the Open Source Movement - Slashdot
_Summarized by: Lila Thompson_ [[news.slashdot.org](https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/07/07/0243241/freebsd-contributor-mocks-gloomy-predictions-for-the-open-source-movement)]

Poul-Henning Kamp, a long-time FreeBSD contributor, humorously refutes claims that the free and open-source software (FOSS) movement is in decline. He argues that FOSS has consistently triumphed over commercial failures since its inception in the early 1990s. Kamp highlights that if affordable and robust Unix systems had been available for PCs, FreeBSD and Linux might not have gained traction. He credits the dot-com boom and the superior performance of FOSS operating systems as pivotal moments for the movement. Kamp concludes that while the frustrations of IT in 2024 differ from those in 1991, the FOSS movement has achieved its core goal of freedom in software.

LeeS2, a new Power Apps user, seeks help with refreshing Dataverse tables connected to Power BI dataflows. Initially set to periodic weekly refresh, LeeS2 can't find an option to change or manually refresh this setting within Power Apps. Mister_Shaik suggests checking the dataflow refresh settings via the Power Apps data integration page or through the environment's "More" section, under "Dataflow." This guidance aims to help LeeS2 manage the refresh settings more effectively.
