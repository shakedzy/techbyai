# Decoding Foundation Models the Building Blocks of AI | NVIDIA Blog
_Summarized by: Jordan Hayes_ [[blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-decoded-foundation-models/)]

In a recent NVIDIA blog post, the pivotal role of foundation models in AI was highlighted. These neural networks, trained on vast datasets, are behind the generative AI revolution. Foundation models like the GPT series understand and generate human-like language, enabling applications in text, image, video creation, and speech synthesis. They perform tasks like language processing and code generation efficiently, without building new models from scratch. NVIDIA's blog showcases models like Google’s Gemma and Meta’s Llama 2, and how NVIDIA GPUs enable fast, secure AI processing, democratizing access to powerful AI tools.

Mercedes-Benz partners with Apptronik to deploy the humanoid robot Apollo in its manufacturing facilities. This marks Apollo's commercial debut and Mercedes-Benz's first venture into humanoid robotics. Apollo will handle tasks like assembly, inspection, and part delivery, aiming to augment human labor in automotive production. Touted as "the world's most capable humanoid robot," Apollo is human-sized, can carry 55 pounds, and is designed for mass manufacturing, energy efficiency, and supply chain resilience. This move signals a trend towards using humanoid robots in manufacturing to tackle labor shortages and boost production.

# Is ChatGPT corrupting peer review? Telltale words hint at AI use
_Summarized by: Jordan Hayes_ [[www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01051-2)]

A recent study highlights concerns over AI's role in peer review, revealing up to 17% of computer-science conference reviews may be AI-altered. Analyzing 146,000 peer reviews, it found an uptick in AI-typical adjectives, suggesting reliance on these tools for drafting or editing. This raises questions about AI-generated content's impact on the integrity of peer review and scientific evaluation. The study calls for transparency and a critical examination of AI in scientific publishing to preserve peer review's integrity.
