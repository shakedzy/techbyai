# NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD to Power US Government Generative AI ...
_Summarized by: Nina Patel_ [[blogs.nvidia.com](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/dgx-superpod-us-government-generative-ai/)]

In response to President Biden's executive order on AI, the U.S. is deploying an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD to boost generative AI research in climate science, healthcare, and cybersecurity. Led by the nonprofit MITRE, this initiative aligns with the executive order's aim to sustain U.S. leadership in AI and manage its risks. The SuperPOD will power MITRE’s Federal AI Sandbox, facilitating AI experimentation across federal agencies. It provides the computational might to train large models, enhancing the development of advanced AI applications. Capable of an exaflop of 8-bit AI compute, the SuperPOD significantly advances the training and deployment of AI solutions at scale. This is part of a broader $110 million initiative to improve AI education at universities.

# Toward In-Context Teaching: Adapting Examples to Students' Misconceptions
_Summarized by: Ava Sinclair_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04495v1)]

The paper introduces ADAPT and ATOM, methods enhancing the use of large language models (LLMs) as educational tools by adapting to students' misconceptions. ADAPT evaluates teaching methods for students with varying misconceptions using simulated and human subjects, while ATOM, a probabilistic model within ADAPT, infers students' beliefs to tailor teaching examples.

ATOM outperforms traditional LLM-based teaching methods and Bayesian models in teaching effectiveness across fraction arithmetic, English morphology, and function learning. Its strength lies in adapting teaching strategies based on real-time student understanding, effectively addressing specific misconceptions.

The study also explores integrating adaptive teaching models with LLMs to boost pedagogical effectiveness, suggesting a future where AI-driven tools personalize learning more effectively.

# QServe: W4A8KV4 Quantization and System Co-design for Efficient LLM Serving
_Summarized by: Ava Sinclair_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04532v1)]

The research paper introduces QServe, a novel system for efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) using a specialized quantization technique. The primary innovation, QoQ (Quattuor-Octō-Quattuor), involves a quantization method that uses 4-bit weights, 8-bit activations, and 4-bit key-value (KV) cache, aiming to optimize the performance of LLMs on GPUs. The QServe system leverages this quantization to perform computations more efficiently by reducing the overhead associated with dequantizing data during model inference.

The paper highlights that traditional INT4 quantization methods often suffer from significant overheads, which reduce their effectiveness in cloud-based LLM serving. To overcome these limitations, the authors developed a progressive quantization approach that minimizes dequantization overhead and enhances computational efficiency. This is achieved by initially quantizing weights to 8 bits and then further reducing them to 4 bits, ensuring that all General Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs) are performed on INT8 tensor cores, which are faster.

Furthermore, the authors introduce a technique called SmoothAttention to mitigate the accuracy loss typically associated with low-bit quantization of the KV cache. This method effectively smooths out the quantization errors, thereby preserving the model's accuracy.

The QServe system also includes several optimizations like compute-aware weight reordering and fused attention mechanisms, which further enhance the serving throughput. The results presented in the paper demonstrate that QServe can significantly improve the efficiency of LLM serving, achieving higher throughput and reducing costs compared to existing systems like TensorRT-LLM.

Overall, the paper proposes a comprehensive solution that addresses the challenges of efficiently serving large-scale LLMs by combining advanced quantization strategies with system-level optimizations, leading to improved performance and cost-effectiveness.

_Summarized by: Elijah Moreno_ [[www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/07/mitre-nvidia-ai-supercomputer-sandbox/)]

MITRE, a federally funded research organization supporting U.S. defense and intelligence, announced a collaboration with Nvidia to construct a $20 million AI supercomputer. This initiative, termed an AI "sandbox," is designed to expedite the integration of advanced AI technologies within various federal agencies, including the Pentagon and the IRS. The project aims to enhance a range of government functions, from Medicare to tax administration, leveraging MITRE's long history of providing innovative technical solutions to the U.S. government since the 1950s.

# xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory
_Summarized by: Ava Sinclair_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04517v1)]

The paper introduces xLSTM, an advanced version of LSTM networks, featuring exponential gating and novel memory structures, sLSTM and mLSTM, for scalar and matrix memory updates respectively. These enhancements allow xLSTM to handle larger datasets more efficiently and improve performance in language modeling tasks, demonstrating superior scalability compared to models like Transformers and State Space Models. This development highlights xLSTM's potential as a valuable tool for robust sequential data processing and prediction.

# AI Expo in DC to discuss technological breakthroughs
_Summarized by: Nina Patel_ [[www.dcnewsnow.com](https://www.dcnewsnow.com/news/local-news/washington-dc/ai-expo-in-dc-promises-to-discuss-breakthroughs-in-technology/)]

The Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP) is hosting its inaugural AI Expo for National Competitiveness on May 7 and 8 at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. This event aims to serve as a platform for various industries to discuss recent technological advancements in fields such as AI, energy, manufacturing, and biotech. Notable participants include major companies like Microsoft, the U.S. Department of Energy, Google, Hermes Robotics, The Digital Chamber, Stairwell, and Current AI. The expo highlights the increasing ease of using AI and the associated risks, such as the potential for creating deepfakes that could spread disinformation, especially in critical election years.
