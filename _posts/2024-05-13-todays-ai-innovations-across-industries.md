# New Machine Learning Algorithm Promises Advances in Computing
_Summarized by: Marcus Chen_ [[www.sciencedaily.com](https://www.sciencedaily.com/news/computers_math/information_technology/)]

Recent advances in technology focus on efficiency and integration across sectors. Blockchain is suggested to unify the UK's transport ticketing, offering transparency and cohesion. In personal tech, new synthetic materials are making devices smaller yet more powerful, potentially transforming daily tech interactions. Machine learning sees improvements with a new algorithm boosting computational processes. Additionally, a robotic system aids those with severe mobility issues, using computer vision and machine learning to support daily activities. These innovations exemplify the integration of materials, AI, and robotics into practical, impactful applications.

# mimic develops breakthrough collaborative robots with humanoid hands powered by generative AI
_Summarized by: Marcus Chen_ [[www.todaysmedicaldevelopments.com](https://www.todaysmedicaldevelopments.com/news/mimic-joins-race-develop-artificial-intelligence-driven-cobot/)]

mimic, a Swiss startup, has entered the robotics arena with a novel approach, using generative AI to create humanoid robots with versatile, human-like hands. Designed to tackle global labor shortages, these robots can perform complex manual tasks in various industries. Originating from ETH Zurich's research and backed by $2.5 million from European investors, mimic's robots differ from traditional robots as they learn and perform diverse activities by observing human actions. This capability could revolutionize labor-intensive sectors by offering a flexible, AI-driven solution to manual labor challenges, enhancing productivity and operational efficiency in areas from supermarkets to pharmaceutical labs. The market potential for such humanoid robots is vast, with projections suggesting a market size of $38 billion by 2035.

AI-powered drug discovery is a promising field that can potentially revolutionize how we find new medications. However, it requires significant patience from investors due to its complex and time-consuming nature. The process involves using AI technologies to identify and develop new drug candidates, a task that traditionally takes many years and involves considerable financial investment. Despite the high costs and long timelines, the potential benefits of faster and more efficient drug discovery processes are compelling. The integration of AI into this sector holds the promise of discovering novel therapies that can address unmet medical needs, leading to significant advances in healthcare. Investors interested in this area must be prepared for a long-term commitment and manage their expectations regarding the speed of returns on their investments.

# AI startups are making their home in New York. Can they turn it into a generative AI hub?
_Summarized by: Marcus Chen_ [[www.livemint.com](https://www.livemint.com/technology/ai-startups-are-making-their-home-in-new-york-can-they-turn-it-into-an-ai-powerhouse-11715505236017.html)]

New York City is rapidly emerging as a significant hub for generative AI, challenging San Francisco's dominance. With $26.8 billion invested in AI firms from 2021 to early 2024, NYC ranks second globally in AI investment. The $400 million "Empire AI" initiative boosts its appeal, enhancing AI research and infrastructure. Industries like finance, healthcare, and law, early AI adopters, fuel this growth due to their regulatory environments and data management capabilities. NYC's ability to attract AI talent is notable, with many tech workers relocating there. AI startups in NYC focus on developing practical AI tools tailored to specific industries, providing a strategic advantage in meeting local business needs.

# AlphaFold 3 extends capabilities to a broad spectrum of biomolecules
_Summarized by: Priya Gupta_ [[www.tekedia.com](https://www.tekedia.com/new-era-in-scientific-discovery-is-unfolding-with-alphafold-3/)]

AlphaFold 3, developed by Alphabet's Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs, marks a significant leap in scientific research and drug discovery. It extends AlphaFold 2's capabilities by predicting the structure and interactions of a wider array of biomolecules, including proteins, DNA, RNA, and ligands. This advancement fosters a deeper understanding of biological processes and could spur the development of more effective medications. The model's accuracy in predicting molecular interactions has improved by at least 50% over existing methods. AlphaFold 3 also contributes to genomics research, the creation of bio-renewable materials, and the development of resilient crops. Its free availability via the AlphaFold Server democratizes this powerful tool, empowering researchers globally to advance their work. The model's profound impact is evidenced by extensive citations in scientific literature and numerous prestigious awards.

# Advances in AI hardware boost AMD's market performance
_Summarized by: Priya Gupta_ [[www.fool.com](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/12/better-tech-stock-intel-vs-amd/)]

Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are key players in the semiconductor industry. Intel, once dominant, is transitioning to an internal foundry model to reclaim its leadership, aiming for $10 billion savings by 2025. Meanwhile, AMD has grown significantly, particularly in AI, making it an appealing investment due to its strong financial performance and strategic tech industry positioning.

# How Airlines Are Using AI to Make Flying Easier
_Summarized by: Marcus Chen_ [[www.nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/travel/airlines-artificial-intelligence.html)]

Airlines are increasingly integrating artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance efficiency and passenger experience. United Airlines' AI tool, ConnectionSaver, held a flight for late passengers, ensuring they made their connection and arrived on time, while keeping them informed via text updates. Other airlines like Alaska and American are developing technologies to streamline operations and reduce costs, including fuel savings. AI is expected to revolutionize aspects of flying such as baggage tracking and personalized in-flight entertainment, making air travel more convenient and less stressful.
