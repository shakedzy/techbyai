# KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
_Summarized by: Alexa Rivers_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19756v1)]

Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a promising alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Unlike MLPs, KANs feature learnable activation functions on edges, replacing every weight with a learnable univariate function parameterized as a spline. This allows KANs to outperform MLPs in accuracy and interpretability. KANs achieve comparable or better results with fewer parameters than MLPs, especially in data fitting and solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). They exhibit faster neural scaling laws and offer intuitive visualizations, making them valuable for scientists to (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. KANs open new avenues for enhancing deep learning models by improving accuracy and interpretability.

# PrivComp-KG : Leveraging Knowledge Graph and Large Language Models for Privacy Policy Compliance Verification
_Summarized by: Alexa Rivers_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19744v1)]

In the digital era, data protection is crucial. Companies often rely on third-party vendors for data handling, introducing vulnerabilities. To address this, laws have been enacted, requiring compliance with complex regulations. This paper presents PrivComp-KG, a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Semantic Web technologies for privacy policy compliance verification. PrivComp-KG, a Knowledge Graph, efficiently stores and retrieves privacy policies, regulatory frameworks, and domain-specific knowledge. Utilizing LLMs and Retrieval Augmented Generation, it identifies relevant policy sections and regulatory rules, achieving a correctness score of 0.9. This aids policy writers in understanding legal requirements, identifying policy gaps, and updating them as regulations evolve.

# Google Gemini: Everything you need to know about the new ...

Google Gemini, by DeepMind and Google Research, introduces three AI models: Ultra, Pro, and Nano, each targeting different tasks. Ultra assists with complex tasks like physics homework, Pro excels in reasoning, and Nano enhances mobile apps with features like summarization. These models are multimodal, handling audio, images, videos, code, and text. Despite past skepticism, Gemini aims for broad capabilities. Ultra requires a $20/month Google One AI Premium Plan, while Pro and Nano cater to developers and mobile users. Google touts Gemini's superior benchmarks, though its effectiveness and value are pending evaluation.

As AI evolves, the challenge of aligning safety and reliability standards becomes paramount. The EU's AI Act, with its risk-based AI systems classification, raises concerns of overregulation, especially in healthcare. Critics argue the "high-risk" categorization may hinder innovation, advocating for sector-specific regulations to balance safety and innovation. The GDPR's mandate on explainability for autonomous decision-making systems underlines the need for context-sensitive regulations. Effective AI regulation requires well-equipped agencies, education, and stakeholder engagement, particularly between regulatory bodies and AI drug development stakeholders, to foster safe healthcare innovation.
