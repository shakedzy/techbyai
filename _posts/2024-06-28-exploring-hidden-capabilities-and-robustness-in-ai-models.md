We investigated the resilience of Large Language Models (LLMs) by manipulating their internal layers, specifically through deletion and swapping. Surprisingly, even without fine-tuning, these models retained 72-95% of their original accuracy. Larger models exhibited greater robustness. Our findings suggest that LLMs undergo four universal stages during inference:

1. **Detokenization**: The model processes raw tokens into higher-level representations by integrating local context. This stage is critical, as deleting or swapping layers here severely disrupts performance.
2. **Feature Engineering**: The model iteratively refines features relevant to the task, significantly improving probing accuracy but not yet making concrete predictions.
3. **Prediction Ensembling**: The model begins converting features into next-token predictions. This stage shows robustness due to the ensemble-like behavior of the model components.
4. **Residual Sharpening**: The final layers refine the token prediction by eliminating noise, ensuring the output is precise.

We validated these stages across various models, including GPT-2 and Pythia, by examining attention patterns, neuron roles, and intermediate prediction distributions. Our study provides a framework for understanding the complex inference processes in LLMs, highlighting their robustness and the intricate mechanisms underlying their predictions.

# Efficient World Models with Context-Aware Tokenization
_Summarized by: Elena Martinez_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19349v1)]

IndoToxic2024 is a new dataset aimed at improving hate speech and toxicity detection in Indonesian. It consists of 43,692 entries annotated by 19 diverse individuals, focusing on texts targeting vulnerable groups, especially during the presidential election. Demographic information for each annotator is included, allowing for the study of subjectivity in hate speech annotations.

Researchers established baselines for seven binary classification tasks, achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.78 using a fine-tuned BERT model, IndoBERTweet. They also showed that incorporating demographic information can enhance the zero-shot performance of GPT-3.5-turbo. However, overemphasis on demographic data can negatively impact model performance due to fragmentation.

The study highlights the subjectivity in hate speech annotations, influenced by annotators' backgrounds and experiences. This subjectivity is evident in varying interpretations across demographic groups. The dataset addresses the lack of comprehensive data for Indonesian texts, particularly for marginalized minorities.

# Fundamental Problems With Model Editing: How Should Rational Belief Revision Work in LLMs?
_Summarized by: Elena Martinez_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19370v1)]

Modern generative models, such as text-conditioned diffusion models, exhibit remarkable capabilities due to their ability to identify and manipulate abstract concepts within their training data. This study investigates what determines the concepts a model learns, the order of their learning, and the model's capability to manipulate these concepts. The researchers propose a framework called "concept space," where each axis represents an independent concept underlying the data-generating process. They find that the speed and order of concept learning are influenced by properties of the data, termed "concept signal."

The study reveals moments of sudden changes in the direction of a model’s learning dynamics, corresponding to the emergence of "hidden capabilities"—the model's ability to manipulate a concept that is not yet evident through naive input prompting. This phenomenon was observed using synthetic toy datasets, but the researchers hypothesize it applies broadly to generative models. The findings suggest that generative models possess latent capabilities that emerge consistently during training, though these capabilities might not be apparent without specific prompting techniques.

The paper emphasizes the importance of understanding the learning dynamics in concept space to predict and enhance the performance of generative models in various applications, including robotics, weather forecasting, and drug discovery.

# Jump Starting Bandits with LLM-Generated Prior Knowledge
_Summarized by: Elena Martinez_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19320v1)]

The paper discusses the challenges and advancements in scaling deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, particularly focusing on model-based RL (MBRL) and the development of efficient world models. The proposed agent, ∆-IRIS, introduces a novel architecture that includes a discrete autoencoder to encode stochastic deltas between time steps and an autoregressive transformer to predict future deltas using continuous tokens summarizing the current state of the world. This approach significantly reduces computational demands while maintaining high performance.

The paper highlights the limitations of previous transformer-based world models, which required long sequences of tokens, making them computationally expensive. ∆-IRIS addresses this by encoding only the changes (deltas) between frames, thus reducing the number of tokens needed. This method allows for faster training and better scalability to complex environments.

In experiments using the Crafter benchmark, ∆-IRIS demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, solving 17 out of 22 tasks after 10 million frames of data collection and training ten times faster than previous models. The paper also provides empirical evidence that ∆-IRIS effectively disentangles deterministic and stochastic dynamics, encoding only the stochastic aspects with discrete tokens.

The authors suggest that future improvements could include dynamically varying the number of tokens based on the context and leveraging internal world model representations for a more robust policy. The work emphasizes the importance of accurate simulations in complex environments to mitigate real-world risks.

# Project Kuiper's new satellite facility: A peek into production ramp up for Its first launch
_Summarized by: Raj Patel_ [[www.usnews.com](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2024-06-27/ai-isnt-some-hollywood-robot-fantasy-its-reality-and-biden-and-trump-need-to-explain-how-theyll-harness-it)]

As Joe Biden and Donald Trump prepare for the first presidential debate, a critical question is how they will navigate the AI revolution. AI's impact on jobs, health care, and education is imminent, and Americans are anxious about these changes. Both candidates have a record on AI policy: Trump's 2019 American AI Initiative and Biden's 2023 executive order on AI fairness and transparency. However, there is a lack of rigorous AI policy discussion this election season. Americans deserve to know how each candidate will harness AI for economic growth, innovation, and social good while addressing ethical complexities and security concerns.

# IBM announces new AI assistant and feature innovations at Think 2024
_Summarized by: Aisha Kamara_ [[www.aboutamazon.com](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/inside-project-kuiper-satellite-facility-kirkland)]

Amazon's Project Kuiper is ramping up satellite production at its new 172,000-square-foot Kirkland, Washington facility ahead of its first full-scale launch later this year. The facility, which opened in April, is designed to support the manufacturing and testing of satellites for Kuiper’s low Earth orbit constellation. The project aims to connect millions globally and create advanced manufacturing jobs in Puget Sound. The Kirkland factory, featuring custom equipment and clean spaces, will build up to five satellites per day. Amazon has partnered with local institutions to develop a satellite manufacturing certification program, fostering local talent. The project is supported by national and local leaders, emphasizing job creation and bridging the digital divide.
