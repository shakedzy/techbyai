# GFlow: Recovering 4D World from Monocular Video
_Summarized by: Sophia Martinez_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18426v1)]

The paper presents **GFlow**, a framework designed to reconstruct 4D dynamic scenes from a single monocular video without needing camera parameters. Traditional methods often rely on multiple views, known camera settings, or static scenes, which are impractical for real-world applications. GFlow overcomes these limitations by using 2D priors (depth and optical flow) to build a 4D representation through 3D Gaussian splatting, which clusters the scene into still and moving parts and optimizes camera poses and scene dynamics.

The process involves sequential optimization: first, the camera pose is refined using still Gaussian points to align with depth and optical flow data; then, the Gaussian points are optimized for RGB appearance, depth, and optical flow. This ensures each frame is accurately rendered, maintaining fidelity and smooth transitions. GFlow also introduces a pixel-wise strategy for densifying Gaussian points to integrate new content as scenes evolve.

GFlow's explicit representation allows for various applications such as object tracking, segmentation, novel view synthesis, and scene editing. It demonstrates significant improvements in reconstruction quality and camera pose accuracy compared to existing methods, showcasing its potential to revolutionize video analysis and manipulation.

# DiG: Scalable and Efficient Diffusion Models with Gated Linear Attention
_Summarized by: Sophia Martinez_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18428v1)]

DiG (Diffusion Gated Linear Attention Transformers) is a new model that enhances the efficiency and scalability of visual content generation. Traditional Diffusion Transformers (DiT) face limitations in scalability and computational efficiency due to their quadratic complexity. DiG addresses these challenges by incorporating Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers, which are more efficient in handling long sequences.

DiG introduces a lightweight Spatial Reorient & Enhancement Module (SREM) that improves local awareness and controls layer-wise scanning directions. This module allows DiG to achieve better performance with minimal additional parameters. The model demonstrates significant improvements in training speed and GPU memory usage, being 2.5 times faster and using 75.7% less GPU memory than DiT at high resolutions.

The paper highlights DiG's superior scalability and efficiency compared to other subquadratic-time diffusion models. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset show that DiG consistently outperforms DiT in terms of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), a metric for image generation quality. DiG's design enables it to handle larger model sizes and higher resolutions more effectively, making it a promising backbone for future diffusion models in visual content generation.

# ViG: Linear-complexity Visual Sequence Learning with Gated Linear Attention
_Summarized by: Sophia Martinez_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18425v1)]

Recently, linear complexity sequence modeling networks have shown capabilities similar to Vision Transformers (ViT) in computer vision tasks, with fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) and less memory usage. However, their actual runtime speed advantage is minimal. To address this, the authors introduce Gated Linear Attention (GLA) for vision, leveraging its hardware efficiency. They propose direction-wise gating to capture 1D global context through bidirectional modeling and a 2D gating locality injection to integrate 2D local details into the 1D global context.

Their model, ViG, merges forward and backward scanning into a single kernel, enhancing parallelism and reducing memory cost and latency. ViG offers an optimal trade-off in accuracy, parameters, and FLOPs on ImageNet and downstream tasks, outperforming popular Transformer and CNN-based models. For instance, ViG-S matches DeiT-B's accuracy while using only 27% of the parameters and 20% of the FLOPs, and it runs twice as fast on 224×224 images. At 1024×1024 resolution, ViG-T uses 5.2 times fewer FLOPs, saves 90% GPU memory, runs 4.8 times faster, and achieves 20.7% higher top-1 accuracy than DeiT-T.

These results position ViG as an efficient and scalable solution for visual representation learning, combining the best aspects of Transformers and CNNs.

# Why are Visually-Grounded Language Models Bad at Image Classification?
_Summarized by: Sophia Martinez_ [[<img src="{{ 'images/pdf.png' | relative_url }}" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 1.2em;' /> arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18415v1)]

Visually-grounded language models (VLMs) like GPT-4V and LLaVA, despite their advanced architectures and large parameter counts, underperform in basic image classification tasks compared to models like CLIP. This study investigates why VLMs struggle with image classification, identifying data as the primary issue. Critical information for classification is encoded in the VLM's latent space but can only be effectively decoded with sufficient training data. The performance of VLMs is strongly correlated with the frequency of class exposure during their training. When trained with enough data, VLMs can match the accuracy of state-of-the-art classification models.

To address this, the researchers propose integrating classification-focused datasets into VLM training. This approach not only improves VLMs' classification performance but also enhances their general capabilities. For example, an enhanced VLM showed an 11.8% improvement on the ImageWikiQA dataset, which contains complex questions about ImageNet objects. The study concludes that while VLMs have the potential for advanced visual understanding, their performance is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of training data. Integrating more classification data into VLM training can significantly improve their overall performance.
