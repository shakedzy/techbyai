Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs have introduced AlphaFold 3, an advanced AI model capable of predicting the behavior of biomolecules, including DNA and RNA, beyond just protein structures. Initially launched in 2020, AlphaFold addressed the "protein folding problem" by accurately predicting protein shapes from amino acid sequences, revolutionizing biological research and drug discovery. Its public release accelerated efforts to combat diseases like COVID-19, malaria, and Parkinson's. AlphaFold 3's enhanced capabilities aim to deepen understanding of molecular interactions within biological systems, marking significant progress in computational biology.

During Tesla's shareholder event on May 16, 2023, Elon Musk showcased significant advancements in the Tesla Bot, also known as Optimus. Unlike the previous year's demonstration, where the bot was stationary, the new prototype can now walk, navigate, and pick up items. The video highlighted the bot's motor torque control, environmental discovery, and memorization capabilities, using cameras and sensors to map its surroundings. The Tesla Bot can also learn tasks from human demonstrations, shown by an employee placing items in boxes while the robot mimicked the actions. Despite these advancements, production is not yet imminent, with further refinements needed.
